## Idea Write-Up (verbatim from Leo)

Society has an authenticity problem.
are people's lives really what they make them out to be on social media?
is that content you just saw fake?
and nowhere is this crisis of authenticity felt more than amongst America's singles population.
millions of single american's craving the one thing that is the hardest to come by -
the real deal.
kraft singles, america's original melted cheese, is here to change that.
and we're going to start with the great american hamburger.
and a commitment that every new relationship should start off on the right foot.
introducing The Perfect Melt.
two people being their most authentic and original selves.
and in between them a hamburger doing exactly the same.
no cheese masquerading as kraft single.
no hamburger pretending to be a hamburger.
but a hamburger made as it was always intended,
with kraft singles
for a generation of american singles in search of authenticity
