will   ferrell (real- time   Scroller) This   idea   will   use   the   opening   game   of   the   World   Series  as   its   platform. The   crowd   will   see   Will   Ferrell   appear   on   the   giant   screens  around   the   field.   He’ll   simply   open   a   laptop   and   do   a   google  search   for   himself.   as   we   see   the   results   on   screen   he  begins   to   strip   in   the   background. He   looks   into   camera   and   says,   “Watch   this”. now   he’ll   actually   run   onto   the   field   in   a   nappy.   as   he   runs  around,   on   the   giant   screens   that   still   show   the   laptop,   the  real-time   scroller   start   to   kick   in.   it   reads: Will   Ferrell   just   streaked   the   World   Series.   I   just   saw   Will   Ferrell   streak.   No   joke. Will   Ferrell   made   this   the   funniest   World   Series   ever.   Ferrell   streaks   the   World   Series. He   runs   back   indoors,   reappearing   on   the   big   screen,   and  shouts   “Demo   Slam!”

### Slide 22

Sergeant   PePPer   cover (google   goggles) a   group   of   friends   with   a   bunch   of   makeshift   props,   costumes   and   wigs  try   to   recreate   the   iconic   Sergeant   pepper   album   cover   to   be   recognized  by   google   goggles. By   dressing   up,   tweaking   all   the   life-sized   cutouts,   moving   the   little   dolls,  the   figurines,   and   the   plants,   they   position   everything   just   right.   it’s  through   sheer   creativity   and   ingenuity   that   they   pull   it   off. eventually   they   erupt   when  goggles  recognizes   the   album.   We   hear  someone   shout,   “Demo   Slam!”

### Slide 23

echo (voice   Search) We   see   a   few   skater   friends   in   a   huge   pipe,   the   perfect   echo   chamber.  one   guy   activates   Voice   Search   and   shouts   “Boutros”. His   voice   starts   echoing   “Boutros,   Boutros,   Boutros...”   and   we   see  the   screen   as   it   picks   up   each   echo. Finally   we   see   on   the   screen: Did   you   mean   Boutros   Boutros   Ghali? They   all   shout   and   cheer,   laughing   that   the   phone   corrected  the   multiple   ‘Boutroses’.

### Slide 24

Pizza (local   Search   integration) We   see   a   girl   who   motions   for   us   to   follow   what   she’s   doing.   on   the  google   search   page,   she   changes   her   location   to   Los   angeles   and  searches   for   a   homeless   shelter   in   Compton.   Using   local   search  integration,   she   finds   a   pizza   place   closest   to   the   shelter   and   orders  40   pizzas   online. She   then   changes   her   location   to   detroit   and   finds   a   local   orphanage,  a   local   pizza   place   and   does   the   same. She   repeats   the   process   in   denver   and   east   Saint   Louis. She   smiles   and   says,   “2   minutes.   4   cities.   And   400   happy   people.” We   might   want   to   see   a   montage   of   the   effect   of   this   act   –   a   montage  of   the   different   shelters   in   these   cities   receiving   their   pizzas.
