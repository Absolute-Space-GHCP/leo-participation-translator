Let’s tap into the viral sidelines chatter we hear from mic’d up players and coaches. We’ll have people like Joe Flacco narrating their kid’s U4T journey through the notifications.  We can show Padma on set of her cooking show, getting interrupted while she interviews a chef, showing her checking her daughter’s U4T notifications.  We’ll have Usher (or another parent guest) do a special segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live, where mid-interview, he stops to check his kid’s U4T journey.  We’ll partner with a makeup influencer to post content that gets interrupted by their child’s U4T notifications.

Influencers who  “Keep It Oscar”  Keep it Oscar is a way of seeing the world differently. It’s about bringing unexpected smiles to people and not taking things too seriously.

Example: @skincarebyhyram Food  Influencers who in the food category who have fun with  a non traditional approach to food, recipes, and cooking.

Example:  @awkwafina Wild Card  For all those influencers who don’t fit in a neat little box and have the right mindset for this product.  For example, are there gift guide influencers we can tap?

JAZMINE MCCOY    Dr. Jazmine educates her audience through written content, podcast-style discussions, and  talking-head  videos, with the latter feeling the most authentic, followed closely by her podcast-style content. Known as the “mom psychologist” and backed by her doctorate and licensure in psychology, she brings a high level of credibility and trust to everything she shares.

She isn’t just siloed to creating skits, she’s also produced  talking-head–style  videos that feel candid &amp; direct. Typically, she is turning real family dynamics into humor, which makes her content highly shareable and deeply relatable. She’s even created playful commentary about being a  Roblox parent , showing she already taps into Roblox culture in a way that feels natural.

‹#› PARENTING, LIFESTYLE AND EDUCATION CREATOR N’MMAH  (A TRIBE CALLED PARENTS)    196k 5k N’mmah’s teacher-mom background and community-centered voice resonate with parents who value authenticity, guidance, and learning, all of which align strongly with Roblox’s “educational play” narrative. She’s also already created  Roblox-related content : in one video, she calmly walks her daughter through the consequences of a months-long account suspension, using it as a teachable moment about rules and responsibility. The conversation is warm, grounded, and ends with her daughter excited to rejoin her friends, a natural example of healthy parent–child dynamics around Roblox.  N’mmah also mixes in  talking-head–style videos  that feel candid and approachable, making her a great fit for the clear, conversational storytelling this campaign needs.

‹#› VLOGGERS, EDUCATORS AND COMMUNITY- BUILDERS JOHN GREEN     2.8M 2.3M 2.8M Best known for their long-running VlogBrothers channel and signature  talking-head style , Hank and John Green have built a massive, deeply engaged, cross-platform following. Even though neither has created Roblox content, they are frequently tagged across the internet to explain things that confuse, overwhelm, or simply fascinate people, making them a go-to source for clarity, context, and everyday understanding. Both Greens are also parents (John with his tween/teen &amp; Hank with a at least 6 yr old? He’s been elusive), which adds another layer of resonance for this campaign. Their lived experience as parents, combined with their reputation for translating complex topics into simple, human language, makes them strong partners for Roblox’s more thoughtful, trust-building storytelling moments.

‹#› DOWN-TO-EARTH CONTENT CREATOR NAT ALISE    Nat creates  down-to-earth  parenting content that feels honest, funny, and relatable. She’s also touched Roblox before — she’s held  virtual  meet-and-greets on the platform in 2020 and even made a playful  skit  involving “Robux.” The fact that she already engages with Roblox culture (and does so in a way that resonates with parents and kids) makes her a strong match for clear, conversational storytelling around family online play. 2.5M 28k 19k

‹#›    Creator Recommendations *Pending BA review  NEW ADDITIONAL AUS CREATORS  DR. ANITA VANDYKE NICHOLAS NAITANUI SAM THAIDAY Roblox Creators Update

---

### Slide 46

‹#› A FUN-LOVING, FAMILY-FIRST VOICE SAM THAIDAY    Sam brings a fun-loving energy to his content. As an Indigenous Australian creator with two daughters of Roblox-playing age, he naturally speaks to real family dynamics through his content. He often creates candid  talking-head  videos and playful family content. His recent visibility as  King of the Jungle  on I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here has only strengthened his trust and recognition with Australian audiences. Sam also shows he can hold both humor and seriousness in his storytelling, including content around  mental health , which positions him well to talk honestly about digital life and online safety.   Watchout: he did face criticism in 2017 for a  racist joke  but publicly apologized. 207k 111k

### Slide 47

‹#› A GROUNDED, AUTHENTIC PRESENCE NICHOLAS NAITANUI    Nic Naitanui carries significant credibility and national recognition as a beloved former AFL player, and he brings a calm, thoughtful presence that parents already respond to. As a Fijian Australian father, he adds cultural representation and an important dad perspective to the mix. While his kids aren’t yet at Roblox-playing age, he can speak meaningfully to how he’s preparing to navigate online play as they grow.  Nic doesn’t currently create much video-driven content, so his involvement would likely require simple, guided formats, but his reputation, authenticity, and family-first positioning make him a credible and trusted voice for Australian parents. 149k 17k

### Slide 48

‹#› INTENTIONAL, VALUES-DRIVEN PARENTING DR. ANITA VANDYKE    Dr. Anita’s content centers on intentional, values-driven parenting. Born in Guangzhou, raised in Australia, she brings a globally informed perspective to parenting. As a rocket scientist, medical doctor, bestselling author, and mother, she brings credibility and thoughtful intention that parents naturally trust. Her video content, often driven by  vo narration , is polished yet warm and could translate into a clear, educational narrative for the campaign.  While her focus is primarily on sustainability and low-waste living, she does include her children in her content and can authentically speak to how her family approaches screen time, creativity, and online play. There’s no visible confirmation that her children play Roblox today, but her “conscious parent” positioning offers a strong foundation for discussing healthy digital engagement.  76k

> **Speaker Notes:**
> I will leave behind a world that the future can enjoy. We should reject what’s “better” to pursue what’s best for all. I believe a hospitable world should allow everyone access. I want to make the world a livable place for everybody, changing our culture so that people can enjoy it later. I want to create a better world and pursue what’s best for everyone, rather than the individual. I want to fight the notion of “normal”, because the world isn’t built for everyone as it is right now.
