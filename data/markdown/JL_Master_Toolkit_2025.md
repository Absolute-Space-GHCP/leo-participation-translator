OUR FOUNDING PHILOSOPHY

---

### Slide 48

ABOUT US Harnessing consumers as our medium, we’re able to develop creative platforms that energize modern communications ecosystems. Rather than a top-down traditional approach, we create brand ideas that galvanize audiences ground-up across digital and social channels, which are then supported and fueled by high-reach vehicles, not the other way around.      The result is brand platforms that move the masses to become ardent allies of the brand, driving outsized business results and transformation. Founded in New York City in 2007, we are an independent creative agency built for a world where humans are the most influential vehicles for ideas to spread.  By blending the powerful traits of long-term brand building with a modern approach to generating consumer participation, that acknowledges the audience as a starting point rather than an endpoint for our messages, we have profoundly impacted some of the world’s most influential brands at their most important moments.
