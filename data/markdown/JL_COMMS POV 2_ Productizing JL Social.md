2 core service areas that we  should  to develop capabilities in. WHAT’S MISSING? Creator  Social Defined :  Work that is co-created between brand, agency &amp; creator with the intent of having them create content that makes brands/products more relevant to the consumers they wish to reach.  JL Competency :  Nascent  We’ve become quite adept at identifying the right creators for the right brands; but need to develop processes for briefing and co-creating in ways that builds long-term relationships, and yield better creator collab outputs. Commerce  Social Defined :  Social content that serve up multivariate ways i with different ‘ways-in’ at getting consumers to think about using a product - increasingly  ultimately  leading to direct social purchase. Loreal partnered with  Mikayla  for a campaign using outrage marketing. The Four Seasons Orlando partnered with baby Kate Wise for social content following a viral  video  feat the brand JL Competency :  Nascent  We’ve got desire to play in this space, but we really haven’t developed ‘muscle’ or work in this space - yet.  While it feels more specialist agency, as more commerce moves to mobile &amp; social; it  will  become a tablestakes offering for modern agencies.

ANTHONY EDWARDS

### Slide 27

‹#› OBJECTIVES Introduce Anthony Edwards—not just the person, but as an idea Ensuring we introduce him to the world while fostering his fandom  Cement the AE1 as a symbol of self-belief Mark the sneaker as a must-have for those who always bet on themselves  Push up against the cultural tension of insecurity not just by  what  we say, but  how Break category conventions to make this a launch that’s talked about through content and entertainment, not just seen via a campaign—in the same vein as Pharrell’s $1mm LV bag, or Versace’s green dress. 03 | OBJECTIVES

### Slide 31

WHAT’S THE LEARNING  The AE1 campaign was a classic. It won at Cannes and is easily one of the best campaigns of the year. In terms of opportunity, social activations and stunts were asked for by clients, but didn’t happen.  TALKING WITH THE TEAM, THE REASON FOR  ONLY SOCIAL FILMS CAME DOWN TO BUDGET.

### Slide 35

WHAT’S THE LEARNING  In the end we made KMC and OM great campaigns . With all the  necessary  assets to  fulfill  the media plan, but we did present awesome social ideas. The problem is that in madness of getting a territory bought, polished and delivered, true social activation is seen as a less important extension.  WE ARE SEEN AS THE FILM/MEDIA PLAN DELIVERABLE AGENCY, NOT THE SOCIAL.

Tiers of social excellence    Good Community Management Good social ideas connected to a greater campaign True social  first ideas

> **Speaker Notes:**
> Good Community Management  Good Social Ideas connected to greater campaign True Social First ideas

---

### Slide 40

Good Community Management Social media's original purpose was human connection. Some brands have nailed this by showcasing their personality and engaging with their audience. Brands like Duolingo, Starry, and Sesame Street's Elmo use their unique personalities to create online personas that naturally engage with their audience.

> **Speaker Notes:**
> elmo duolingo

---

### Slide 41

Good social ideas connected to a greater campaign Even if &quot;social first&quot; doesn't fit the campaign, social media can still drive traffic and support broader goals. Cerave had a TikTok influencer pretend to catch Michael Cera signing bottles at a convenience store, which led curious users to search and find the film on YouTube.

---

### Slide 42

True social first ideas There is a level of connection and authenticity in social first campaigns that you can’t get from a film. Taco Bell had Doja Cat speak candidly to her fans and then spit a purposely corny rap about missing their Mexican Taco.
