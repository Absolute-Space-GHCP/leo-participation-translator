### Slide 4

OUR STRATEGY ‹#› ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26

---

### Slide 5

WE HAVE A CONSUMER WIRED TO ANTICIPATE WHAT’S NEXT - SO MUCH IT BECOMES ITS OWN TENSION  Always scanning for the next innovation in both performance or design.  Conditioned to believe the future is always more complex, more layered, more extra.   They expect the next big thing because they’ve been trained to look for it, associating innovation with visible, often loud, technological advances.  ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26

---

### Slide 6

AND A SHOE THAT USED TECHNOLOGY NOT TO KEEP ADDING, BUT TO REIMAGINE    One word: Breathability.   The innovation isn't a flashy add-on; it's in the very structure of the shoe.  A first-of-its-kind, fully 3D-printed seamless silhouette designed for one elemental purpose: to let your feet breathe.   ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26

---

### Slide 7

SO WHAT IF WE CUT THROUGH THE NOISE WITH THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL INNOVATION OF ALL:  BREATH .  In a category that views innovation as layered excess, we will position Climacool as a return to what matters most. Performance that feels effortless, natural and just...deeply human.   ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26

---

### Slide 8

GIVING  ‘THE FUTURE NOW’  A WHOLE NEW MEANING  In a category obsessed with noise and flashes, Climacool redefines innovation by returning to what’s essential: breathing.  “The Future Now” isn’t about adding more,  it’s about designing smarter, simpler, and more human.  A shoe that proves the most advanced thing you can feel is ease. ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26

### Slide 9

BORN TO BREATHE ‹#› ‹#› STRATEGIC LINE CLIMACOOL SS26

---

### Slide 10

‹#› You know that moment when everything feels too loud? Too tight. Too much. So you stop, take a breath—and suddenly things make sense again?  That breath doesn’t just calm you down. It clears the way. It reminds you who you are. and how you want to move through the world.  That’s the feeling we followed. After years of seeing the same kind of shoe out there, we stepped back, took a breath, and built something different.  Not louder. Not bulkier. Something lighter. Something that was easier. Something that didn’t forget the only way to feel something is to be able to feel in the first place.  We were born to breathe. And now—finally—our shoe is too.   B O R N     T O     B R E A T H E CLIMACOOL SS26

### Slide 11

‹#› ANTHONY EDWARDS 2  | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025       WHAT DOES RESPITE LOOK LIKE ON SOCIAL? BUT until then, we can’t just tell our audience about the feeling of Climacool, we'll give it to them. We're going to use social media as a space to deliver the very same sensation Climacool provides: a chance to stop, take a breath, and feel a moment of respite. ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26 THE ONLY WAY TO FEEL THE SHOE IS TO FEEL THE SHOE

### Slide 12

‹#› ANTHONY EDWARDS 2  | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025       NOW THAT WE’VE TAKEN YOU THROUGH THE STRATEGY LET’S TALK AUDIENCE ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26

---

### Slide 13

‹#› ANTHONY EDWARDS 2  | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025       BUILDING A BRIDGE BETWEEN AUDIENCES ‹#› We know our core consumers are cultural trendsetters, giving the brand credibility at the heart of culture.  You’ve identified a broader audience for social,  The Athletic Consumer,  to ensure mass reach and product resonance. To connect the two, we’ve defined an adjacent audience that bridges core loyalty with broader cultural influence, keeping the brand both credible and future-facing.  By bringing these groups together, we stay rooted in the buyer base while pushing the brand forward.    Athletic Consumer Our Audience Core Consumer CLIMACOOL SS26

---

### Slide 14

‹#› ANTHONY EDWARDS 2  | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025       WHAT DOES THIS AUDIENCE LOOK LIKE? While the core audience shapes culture and the athletic consumer follows it, both share key traits that matter most: they’re socially connected, trend-savvy young adults who blend style, activity, and curiosity. They’re always chasing what’s new, sharing what’s cool, and staying ahead of the curve.   This shared mindset is what we’re going to focus on. ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26

### Slide 15

‹#› ANTHONY EDWARDS 2  | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025       BUT THERE’S A  DOUBLE - EDGED SWORD TO BEING SO TAPPED IN  Their power comes from being hyper-connected and socially fluent but that constant exposure also leaves them vulnerable to endless social media noise  ‹#› CLIMACOOL SS26

### Slide 16

### Slide 21

‹#› ANTHONY EDWARDS 2  | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025       FINDING THE CALM IN THE CHAOS Even in the chaos, social media’s draw has always been the communities people created when they couldn’t find them anywhere else. Spaces of solace, support, and belonging. ‹#›
