### Slide 3

OUR CRITERIA   When looking for the perfect influencer partner for BacOff, we focused on three primary areas:  Alignment of bacon/meat specific content Recognition of face and personality  Reel Engagement Rate  Additionally, we looked at audience demo reach for these influencers, keeping in mind we strategically want to reach a diverse audience. Please see below for our recommended meat influencers  in priority order.  *Please note that while most of these influencers are likely within our $15k budget, we will still need to conduct official outreach. There is no guarantee that these influencers will be interested or within our budget but we plan to negotiate to get the best partner for the project.

He’s a great intersection of both what our GenPop audience might relate to, and what we’re looking for as we  launch BacOff.  Additionally he has  run  giveaways before which garnered great engagement. Though his audience demo isn’t as diverse, his Reel ER is well above benchmark and we’re loving his approach to meat.
