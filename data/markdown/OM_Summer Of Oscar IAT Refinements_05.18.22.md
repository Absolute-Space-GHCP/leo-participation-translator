### Slide 3

A REMINDER - THE SUMMER OBJECTIVE: Make KIO an iconic part of American summer culture by celebrating our wieners in our signature, wonderfully odd way.   THE STRATEGY: Liberate hot dogs from the expected tropes by celebrating the surprising ways that people can enjoy hot dogs in the summer.   Keep it Oscar | Summer of Oscar —   STUPID OR GENIUS

### Slide 6

IDEA POV   Some of the world’s most entertaining creations tread the fine line between stupid and genius – like the Pop Art that Oscar Mayer has created since the beginning, turning the everyday and mundane into unexpected moments of levity. We’ll help our audience see the lighter, not-so-serious side of life… by creating an entertaining debate that will last all summer long.   This idea taps into an existing behavior; people are experimenting with bizarre food content and sharing it with the masses, which is leading to  debate . Stupid  Or Genius hits the main hallmarks of what makes Keep It Oscar so great: the simplicity, the unexpected levity, and the irreverence.  NOTE: Provide a POV on why we believe Stupid or Genius  works for OM/KiO. The questions that we should look to answer are: Is it consistent/expected in culture or are we co-opting that general idea but “oscarfy-ing” how it shows up?  STUPID GENIUS? OR  Keep it Oscar | Summer of Oscar —   STUPID OR GENIUS

### Slide 7

Some internet foods are stupid.  Some  are genius. Oscar Mayer sparks the debate that’s on all our minds with #StupidOrGenius. IDEA IN A SENTENCE

> **Speaker Notes:**
> Oscar Mayer proves that the fine line between Stupid and Genius is a Hot Dog.  / The fine line between stupid &amp; genius is an Oscar Mayer wiener.  When debating between stupid or genius with hot dogs, the answer is yes.    Stupid? Or Genius? You be the judge, but   There’s no such thing as a stupid way to enjoy a Hot Dog, so we asked the world to prove it.    Even the most stupid way to eat a Hot Dog, could be genius.    We sparked the sizzling debate on summer Hot Dog shenanigans by asking the world if Hot Dog creations are Stupid Or Genius.   We debuted all the weird ways people enjoy Hot Dogs in the summer and let the world decide: Stupid Or Genius?   We want to pose a simple question to the world, “is there is a stupid or genius way to enjoy a Hot Dog?”.  What some find stupid, others might find genius. This summer we will prove this with Hot Dogs.   Over the years we’ve served America with our Famous wieners. This summer it's time to celebrate all the stupid or genius ways that people enjoy them.   We want to take all the wonderfully odd ways that people enjoy their Hot Dogs, serve it to the world and let the people decide: is this Stupid or Genius.    Oscar Mayer joins the Internet’s crazy food experiments by using hot dogs to ask what we’re all thinking: Are these foods stupid or genius?

We’ll shoot in a red or yellow studio, with select props to create abstractions of our Summer moments. You’ll get where we’re at, without us  actually  being there.

### Slide 20

SOCIAL &amp; THE KITCHEN We caught up with the Kitchen today, and are really excited to partner and push this campaign to be as big as it has potential to be. In our eyes, volume+engagement is everything, so we’d love to align on what we imagine being ideal numbers of additional assets to live on/across social channels:  What can we align on as a number of deliverables for social?  (IG + Twitter) What’s the ideal number of reactionary posts we strive for this Summer?

### Slide 26

THE INFLUENCER STRATEGY

---

### Slide 27

Influencers Share their own “Genius” Ideas  ​ *Note: Zeno will provide recommended influencers across various verticals in a scorecard format to ensure they match the creative direction and brand personality.  We’ll also make sure we can repurpose content on our owned channels .  We’ll tap into macro influencers  and ask them to reinvent the OMW too… ​ ​ Remember when  Emily’s Salmon Bowl  had a death grip on your FYP page? Influencers share their most creative uses for Oscar Meyer wieners - ridiculous, impressive, and/or ground breaking and ask their audiences to do the same!  ​ ​ This will generate virality of the “stupid or genius” recipe(s), positioning the Oscar Meyer weiner as the vessel and star of the trends to come.    Keep it Oscar | Summer of Oscar —   Stupid or Genius

---

### Slide 28

Social media foodies remain one of the best ways to stay up to date on the latest food trends. Consumers rely on their favorite foodies to try the newest and weirdest creations on the market, providing a seamless way in for Oscar Mayers summer program.       Keep it Oscar | Summer of Oscar —   Stupid or Genius Stupid or Genius Creator Verticals Foodies Lifestyle/Comedy Influencers that mix relatable comedy into their everyday experiences, including how and what they’re eating, allowing us to reach new audiences (and customers). @Mattpeterson_ 6M Followers  @Foodwithmichel 275K Followers  @Delaneysayshello 1M Followers @CorporateNatalie 400K Followers This campaign will use  macro influencers  to activate their large audiences for co-creation with the “stupid or genius” concept. These creators will share content that not only engages consumers, but influences them to co-create with the influencer through stitch videos and hashtags - furthering the reach for Oscar Mayer.

### Slide 29

*Note: Zeno will provide recommended influencers across various verticals in a scorecard format to ensure they match the creative direction and brand personality.  We’ll also make sure we can repurpose content on our owned channels .  Influencers Bite Into the First Icy Cold Oscar Mayer Wiener We’ll tap into macro and mid-tier influencers and ask them to share the news about the NEW COLD WEINER in town … ​ ​​ Share the Oscar Mayer Wiener “cold mold,” offer free molds to their audiences and capture “tastes tests” of the first cold dog. Alternatively, these influencers can drive traffic to where  consumers can purchase.  ​ Influencers local to retail locations (i.e. Popbar store or Wienermobile stop)  would sample on-site, sharing content from the store or WMB activation. ​ Invite NYC influencers to media house events and be the first to taste and share.   Keep it Oscar | Summer of Oscar —   Stupid or Genius

### Slide 30

These influencers share the ups and downs of their everyday experiences with their followers. They give the “cold dog” experience a casual look and encourage their audience to give it a try.

We will select influencers that align with the wienermobile stops so that the influencers can spread awareness for the activation to their local communities and make sure all their followers get the opportunity to experience a “cold dog”. There’s nothing funnier than someone else’s reaction to something new and bizarre. These comedic creators will taste test cold dogs on camera and share their opinion live with their followers.
