### Slide 5

‹#› “THE MOM PSYCHOLOGIST” DR. JAZMINE MCCOY    Dr. Jazmine educates her audience through written content, podcast-style discussions, and  talking-head  videos, with the latter feeling the most authentic, followed closely by her podcast-style content. Known as the “mom psychologist” and backed by her doctorate and licensure in psychology, she brings a high level of credibility and trust to everything she shares. Partnering with her offers Roblox the opportunity to engage parents with content that is both informative and genuinely trustworthy, delivered by a creator who balances expertise with approachability. 4k 1.1M 42k

### Slide 6

‹#› MILLENNIAL MOM CREATOR WHO SHARES REAL-LIFE PARENT CONTENT LEEANN BRAUN    124k 260k 84k Her comedic parenting voice brings an authentic, approachable perspective that connects with a wide parent audience. She isn’t just siloed to creating skits, she’s also produced  talking-head–style  videos that feel candid &amp; direct. Typically, she is turning real family dynamics into humor, which makes her content highly shareable and deeply relatable. She’s even created playful commentary about being a  Roblox parent , showing she already taps into Roblox culture in a way that feels natural.

---

### Slide 7

‹#› PARENTING, LIFESTYLE AND EDUCATION CREATOR N’MMAH  (A TRIBE CALLED PARENTS)    196k 5k N’mmah’s teacher-mom background and community-centered voice resonate with parents who value authenticity, guidance, and learning, all of which align strongly with Roblox’s “educational play” narrative. She’s also already created  Roblox-related content : in one video, she calmly walks her daughter through the consequences of a months-long account suspension, using it as a teachable moment about rules and responsibility. The conversation is warm, grounded, and ends with her daughter excited to rejoin her friends, a natural example of healthy parent–child dynamics around Roblox.  N’mmah also mixes in  talking-head–style videos  that feel candid and approachable, making her a great fit for the clear, conversational storytelling this campaign needs.

### Slide 8

‹#› VLOGGERS, EDUCATORS AND COMMUNITY- BUILDERS JOHN GREEN      2.8M 2.3M 2.8M Best known for their long-running VlogBrothers channel and signature  talking-head style , Hank and John Green have built a massive, deeply engaged, cross-platform following. Even though neither has created Roblox content, they are frequently tagged across the internet to explain things that confuse, overwhelm, or simply fascinate people, making them a go-to source for clarity, context, and everyday understanding. Both Greens are also parents (John with his tween/teen &amp; Hank with a at least 6 yr old? He’s been elusive), which adds another layer of resonance for this campaign. Their lived experience as parents, combined with their reputation for translating complex topics into simple, human language, makes them strong partners for Roblox’s more thoughtful, trust-building storytelling moments.

‹#› COMEDY DUO AND CREATORS OF THE ‘I MOM SO HARD’ PODCAST KRISTIN HENSLEY &amp; JEN SMEDLEY  (I MOM SO HARD)    130k 567k 1.5M 96k Kristin &amp; Jen’s high-engagement humor spans formats from scripted  skits  to sit-down,  podcast-style  videos, covering topics from everyday relatable moments to current events. This versatility makes their content highly adaptable, and we can leverage their style to create engaging, shareable experiences for Roblox. Additionally, their strong mom audience brings a personality-driven perspective that can humanize Roblox in a fun and approachable way.

### Slide 11

‹#› DOWN-TO-EARTH CONTENT CREATOR NAT ALISE    Nat creates  down-to-earth  parenting content that feels honest, funny, and relatable. She’s also touched Roblox before — she’s held  virtual  meet-and-greets on the platform in 2020 and even made a playful  skit  involving “Robux.” The fact that she already engages with Roblox culture (and does so in a way that resonates with parents and kids) makes her a strong match for clear, conversational storytelling around family online play. 2.5M 28k 19k

### Slide 12

‹#› PARENT OF TEENS &amp; TODDLERS LAUREN  (twinsplusthree)    Lauren is a mom of teens, twin toddlers, and a middle child, giving her a wide-age perspective on parenting. She blends trendy content with more  authentic  vlogging, which makes her storytelling feel flexible and her family has already leaned into gaming culture (including a  Minecraft-themed  birthday) showing she’s open to sharing how games show up in her kids’ lives.  201k 49k 33k

### Slide 13

‹#› “HONEST MOM” MILES     Miles shares candid, straightforward parenting content that positions her as a relatable guide for other parents. One of her children already plays  Roblox  and that existing connection paired with her honest tone, makes her a natural partner for helping parents understand what digital life looks like for kids today and how they can stay engaged. 61k

‹#›    Creator Recommendations *Pending BA review  NEW ADDITIONAL AUS CREATORS  DR. ANITA VANDYKE NICHOLAS NAITANUI SAM THAIDAY Roblox Creators Update

---

### Slide 15

‹#› A FUN-LOVING, FAMILY-FIRST VOICE SAM THAIDAY    Sam brings a fun-loving energy to his content. As an Indigenous Australian creator with two daughters of Roblox-playing age, he naturally speaks to real family dynamics through his content. He often creates candid  talking-head  videos and playful family content. His recent visibility as  King of the Jungle  on I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here has only strengthened his trust and recognition with Australian audiences. Sam also shows he can hold both humor and seriousness in his storytelling, including content around  mental health , which positions him well to talk honestly about digital life and online safety.   Watchout: he did face criticism in 2017 for a  racist joke  but publicly apologized. 207k 111k

### Slide 16

‹#› A GROUNDED, AUTHENTIC PRESENCE NICHOLAS NAITANUI    Nic Naitanui carries significant credibility and national recognition as a beloved former AFL player, and he brings a calm, thoughtful presence that parents already respond to. As a Fijian Australian father, he adds cultural representation and an important dad perspective to the mix. While his kids aren’t yet at Roblox-playing age, he can speak meaningfully to how he’s preparing to navigate online play as they grow.  Nic doesn’t currently create much video-driven content, so his involvement would likely require simple, guided formats, but his reputation, authenticity, and family-first positioning make him a credible and trusted voice for Australian parents. 149k 17k

### Slide 17

‹#› INTENTIONAL, VALUES-DRIVEN PARENTING DR. ANITA VANDYKE    Dr. Anita’s content centers on intentional, values-driven parenting. Born in Guangzhou, raised in Australia, she brings a globally informed perspective to parenting. As a rocket scientist, medical doctor, bestselling author, and mother, she brings credibility and thoughtful intention that parents naturally trust. Her video content, often driven by  vo narration , is polished yet warm and could translate into a clear, educational narrative for the campaign.  While her focus is primarily on sustainability and low-waste living, she does include her children in her content and can authentically speak to how her family approaches screen time, creativity, and online play. There’s no visible confirmation that her children play Roblox today, but her “conscious parent” positioning offers a strong foundation for discussing healthy digital engagement.  76k

### Slide 23

‹#› Dr. Becky Kennedy is a beloved parenting psychologist, author, and founder of Good Inside. She’s trusted for research-backed, empathetic parenting advice. Her style of content creation varies from man-on-the-street interviews, podcast-style discussions, written assets, and vlogging, but she has also embraced the more authentic  talking-head  POV filming style. When it comes to children and gaming, she has spoken about how important it is for parents to be the key decision-makers and to set  limits . “PEOPLE CREDIT HER WITH SAVING THEIR PARENTING LIFE”  Corinne Fay &amp; Virginia Sole-Smith   DR. BECKY KENNEDY    314k 3.4M 839k 53k

---

### Slide 24

‹#› Cathy’s content will feature her family, incorporates trends or light skits, but at its core, she focuses on  educating  her audience about keeping families safe, both offline and online. Partnering with her presents an authentic opportunity for Roblox to engage in a meaningful conversation about digital safety, guided by a creator who is not only knowledgeable but also a parent navigating these challenges firsthand. TIKTOK’S “MOM FRIEND” CATHY PEDRAYES    2.6M 331k 5k 85k

> **Speaker Notes:**
> In her content she will showcase her family, jump on trends or do a skit here and there but she typically leans toward educating her audience on how to keep Families Safe whether thats physical or online safety. This could be a great and real conversation with someone who’s content is around safety but who has children herself and how she manages that

### Slide 25

‹#› VIRAL FAMILY CREATOR DUO PENN &amp; KIM HOLDERNESS  (THE HOLDERNESS FAMILY)    1.5M 1.7M 5.3M 407k The Holderness Family content spans relatable moments, trending topics, scripted skits, and podcast-style videos. The  podcast-style  format is particularly compelling for Roblox, as it showcases them at their most authentic while still bringing the signature Holderness humor and joy. Additionally, they have an existing, playful connection to Roblox: back in 2020, Penn and their son created a parody video poking fun at their son for playing  Roblox  over the summer. This demonstrates that they can naturally integrate Roblox into their content in a humorous, family-friendly way.

### Slide 26

‹#› CREATOR OF THE LIFESTYLE BLOG “CUP OF JO”. JOANNE GODDARD    4M 300k 67k Joanne runs a daily women’s lifestyle site that covers style, culture, food, travel, relationships, and parenting. Known for its deeply engaged readership, where visitors “come for the blog, stay for the comments”, the site attracts over 4 million monthly page views and nearly 1 million unique visitors. This makes Cup of Jo an ideal platform for a conversation around Roblox and parenting. There are even readers who have spoken  positively  about Roblox in her blog comments!

### Slide 27

‹#› FAMILY VLOGGER &amp; MOM OF 7 JESSICA SKUBE    4M 1M 307k 2.5M Jessica consistently creates content that resonates with families, and while her channel leans more into skits, trends and family moments, she also mixes in  talking-to-camera  videos that feel direct and engaging. And there’s already clear organic alignment: one of her children dressed in a  Roblox-inspired  costume for Halloween this year, signaling genuine interest and openness to partnering with the brand.
