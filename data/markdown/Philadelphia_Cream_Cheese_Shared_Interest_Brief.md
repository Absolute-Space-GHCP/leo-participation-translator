BRAND &amp; BUSINESS BACKGROUND

---

### Slide 3

PHILLY FACTS RECAP  Philly cream cheese was invented over 150 years ago in 1872 by American dairyman, William Lawrence in Chester, NY. The brand name ‘Philadelphia’ was adopted after a city famous for premium quality food at the time.  Philadelphia is sourced from local farmers and blended at locations in Wisconsin and Lowville, NY. Lowville is so passionate about the brand and the what it does for the local economy that they hold an annual Cream Cheese Festival every Fall.  Philadelphia cream cheese is expertly-blended™ from fresh milk and real cream and crafted for 10+ hours using both. Most of the business is made up of the brick (49%, primarily for baking), soft (46%, primarily for spreading) and whipped (4%, primarily for snacking) products.  Philadelphia holds the Guinness World Record for World’s Largest Cheesecake.

### Slide 7

Consumer research identified  5 barriers  that are preventing Philadelphia’s growth CORPORATE FACTORY “Grey” is drab and boring Factory made, not farm sourced Manufactured Lacking human story LACK OF PERMISSIBILITY Overly Indulgent Associated with sweets and desserts An occasional treat High fat/unhealthy UNCHANGING Seen as lacking innovation Double-edged sword: longevity is trustworthy but feels dated Not keeping up with trends LIMITED USAGE OCCASIONS Primarily bagels and baking – neither are frequent habits Aware of other uses e.g. dips or recipes, but not using in those ways LACK OF EXPERTISE Surface associations of superiority Not sure what makes Philadelphia the best Unknown origins No dairy connection Lack of freshness

### Slide 15

Most people eat Philadelphia, they just don’t  really know  Philadelphia They don’t  really know  the product They don’t  really know  it’s real They don’t  really know  the brand So they  assume it’s just a spread So they  assume it’s “bad” for them So they  assume it’s replaceable

### Slide 16

T H E   P R I M A R Y   S H I F T  GET PEOPLE TO KNOW PHILLY IN A WAY THAT SHIFTS PERCEPTION Philadelphia is “FOR BAGELS” Philadelphia is “FOR THEM”

---

### Slide 17

TO BE  “FOR THEM”   WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEM    ‹#›

---

### Slide 18

In short, they want to create special moments for others and know  good food  is key “We used to be a proper society.” But they’re in a constant tug of war between time &amp; talent   60% Of Millennials  use weekly  and when they put in the effort, it isn’t always worth it.  “I set the table… ready to serve family style, and my family sat down.  And of course, nobody ate.   What was I doing with my one wild and precious life?”   ‹#›

---

### Slide 19

IT ALL ADDS TO A DEFINING GENERATIONAL FEELING THAT  THEY  COULD BE BETTER 74% of all Millennials  want to feel more confident in the kitchen 80% of Millennial parents  want to feel more confident in the kitchen

---

### Slide 20

Yet the category seems like it’s constantly talking to seasoned cooks with infinite time They often sell  inspiration  when people need  confidence

In reality, these other brands don’t actually help them where they need it  Starters Finishers

---

### Slide 22

In reality, these other brands don’t actually help them where they need it  Nobody truly owns this “murky middle” where real cooking and real flavor happens

---

### Slide 23

Which is where Philadelphia has its  biggest impact  as a kitchen staple

---

### Slide 24

Our creamy touch of magic  works its magic where no other brand can  Starters Finishers  Creator

---

### Slide 25

Alternatives in this space come with compromises While Philadelphia is a real ingredient made out of real dairy which is on the comeback Dairy at highest  levels since  40%   1965 -25%  “avoid fat”  since 2004 prefer flavor   ‹#›

---

### Slide 26

PEOPLE WANT TO ENJOY WHAT THEY EAT. IT HAS MADE COOKING GOOD FOOD A REAL PRIORITY. WE HAVE WHAT THEY NEED.  WE JUST NEED TO SHOW THEM THE TRUTH ABOUT PHILLY THAT’S BEEN  HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT.   ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO © 2025

---

### Slide 27

Philadelphia is the missing ingredient that gives you the full flavor you want.   A simpler way to satisfying desserts. Fluffier eggs take  just a touch of Philly. Makes creamier pasta  without overcomplicating.   And on and on, as you’ll see in the work…

---

### Slide 28

3 factors define the full flavor of Philadelphia   MAINTAINING  OUR HERITAGE Our creamy touch of magic was born on a dairy farm 150+ years ago and we stay true even down to using local farms - because you mess with magic.  MADE THE  HARD WAY We don’t believe in shortcuts, which means we still blend fresh milk and real cream for 10+ hours for each batch to reach the standards we set as the creators of cream cheese. EXPERTLY BLENDED FOR BALANCE Our expert blend matters in order to create our unique consistency and balance of a product that’s so creamy yet light &amp; firm yet velvety.

---

### Slide 29

Philadelphia has a wildly  transformative impact on anything it touches.  It’s what makes it a “creamy touch of magic.”  None of this is communicated by the brand today. It doesn’t stand for that at all. Or anything really.  And we need to create a platform  that feels as big as that promise.

### Slide 33

A NOTE ON TONE A KEY ELEMENT TO CRACK!

---

### Slide 34

Our tone should work to address our core challenges.  Tone and personality is key to these two brands who faced similar barriers - and solved it.

---

### Slide 35

To Make Old-Fashioned Feel Fresh Was able to transform the brand from “your grandfather’s scent” to the scent of men who have really become men.  HUMOROUS  MENTOR Brand Persona: Role of Persona:

---

### Slide 36

To Reward Real Culinary Effort Shook people out of leaning on lazy solutions in a way that served as a call to arms to see the possibilities started by Lurpak.  MOTIVATIONAL INSTIGATOR Brand Persona: Role of Persona:

---

### Slide 37

We want to find a personality that is as intentional in not just what it is, but  what it’s trying to accomplish.

---

### Slide 38

To Help Them Find The Full Flavor That’s Always Been Everything you make can be far more flavorful when you discover the original that has made everything better from bagels to sushi rolls: Philadelphia.  TBD Brand Persona: WIP Role of Persona: GOAL ENDPOINT

---

### Slide 39

We want a tone that opens the eyes of Specialness Sprinklers to  discover the full flavor brand they’ve been searching for… yet ignoring:  Those who: Want food to taste special  for their special someones Feel something is missing  from their finished dishes Often overlook the obvious  by overthinking things     Need a brand that: Is seen as bold, not boring Makes them feel  ingenious when they find it Gets them out  of their head

### Slide 40

Personality Traits Defined by the Brand

---

### Slide 41

Initial Tonal Direction  Warm &amp; Inviting We should have heart but NOT be inauthentic   We should ensure this doesn’t become saccharine in a way that conjures up Hallmark tropes. The goal is to help shake off our “cold &amp; corporate” perception. Masterful We should be proud but NOT be “prideful”   Ensure this doesn’t make us feel like cold gatekeepers, but we want to convey we put real work into really great products even used by Junior’s cheesecakes. Lighthearted We should be easy going but NOT “edge-less” We should make this brand feel as light as the product -  especially for our anxious, overthinking target – and have to break our “outdated” vibe. Inventive We should be daring but NOT desperate We want to feel modern, but not like we’re chasing trends at the expense of quality – we just want to make more food and moments taste better.

### Slide 42

BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER

---

### Slide 43

BRIEF ON A PAGE EXACTLY WHAT DOES THIS PROJECT NEED TO DO? Create a new brand platform for Philadelphia that expands how people think of the brand: to make them see Philadelphia cream cheese as essential as butter.  WHO ARE WE ENGAGING WITH THIS WORK? Millennials who want to make food others see as “special” but have struggled to  find the time and effort to get things “great” – especially when such effort doesn’t usually beat out “good enough.”  HOW DO WE NEED THEM TO CHANGE THEIR BELIEFS &amp; BEHAVIORS? We need them to create an identity for Philadelphia beyond being  only  for bagels &amp; cheesecake.  WHAT SURPRISING TENSION COULD WE HELP SOLVE? Other brands help them at the start (butter) and end (sour cream), but no brand truly helps them in the murky middle of the cooking process where real flavor (and cooking anxiety) hits. They assume the path to compelling flavor is complex ingredients - people are overlooking a simple ingredient that can elevate a lot more food than just bagels: Philadelphia cream cheese. They want to make deliciously creamy dishes but often feel lost in how to actually achieve it, which can be found in the originator of cream cheese itself.  THE STRATEGIC THOUGHT PHILADELPHIA. THE FULL FLAVOR YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HAS BEEN HERE ALL ALONG.  REASONS TO BELIEVE A “creamy touch of magic” - Real dairy expertly-blended with fresh milk &amp; real cream. Maintaining True Dairy Roots:  Made from real dairy sourced from local dairy farmers Still Made the Hard Way:  Each batch still takes 10+ hours to reach our standards Expertly Blended for Balance:  Our “creamy touch of magic” requires reaching our unique consistency and balance that’s so creamy yet light &amp; firm yet velvety. WIP

### Slide 44

WE NEED TO BUILD  REAL DAIRY CRED There is a major assumption that we’re some factory-made mystery mixture, but we’re real dairy made the real dairy way… just at scale. We need to break the “processed” presumption.  WE NEED TO BREAK THE COLDNESS OF THE BRAND Our silver &amp; white brand colors are not only cool by definition, but have infected both comms and personality.  There is a real desire to make the brand feel more warm, human, and personable.  WE NEED TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT We’ve long been associated with more indulgent foods like bagels and cheesecake, but to be a kitchen staple we need people to realize how light (yet creamy) we are and make it feel okay to have Philadelphia more often.  EXECUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

---

### Slide 45

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS WHAT’S WORKING Driving desire through food &amp; texture Leaning into distinctive assets (logo and packaging shapes) and associated elements (halos/brackets) Integrating warmth, vibrancy, freshness, and dairy farm cues   WHAT’S NOT WORKING The right balance of branding - sometimes feel like a force-fit to ‘make it look Philly’ or in other instances too light to tie back to the brand Lost dairy heritage in an attempt to modernize the brand Inconsistent use of the logo and font treatments

SCHMER PERFECTION  2020 YOU DON’T JUST TASTE IT. YOU FEEL IT.   2021 What we’ve heard: Hits on RTBs and was well-liked by consumers, there was an internal push that it felt too silly versys charming. The 2024 brief also noted it came across as unapproachable, overly perfect, braggy/snobby, and had a cold tone that risked feeling aloof.  Links to all spots: Introducing the Schmelier :45 ,  :30 Heritage :15 Ingredients :15 Farm to Fridge :15 What we’ve heard: Was an effort to address ‘cold’ perceptions. Beautiful craft and was born from an insight they learned in quals that people described eating Philly as a ‘sensorial experience’ and ‘magic’. However the execution was too ethereal and not credible/believable. The brief leaned too hard into indulgence vs. our new brief to solve permissability.

### Slide 63

WARM &amp; INVITING  We should ensure this doesn’t become saccharine in a way that conjures up  Hallmark tropes that strip our brand of the boldness that drove Philadelphia to create the first cream cheese and, recently, cream cheese frosting.  The goal is to help shake off our “cold &amp; corporate” perception. We should have heart We currently come across as just a cold corporation that doesn’t really “get” people. We are the blue &amp; gray pack that you buy because we’re the most recognizable rather than most relatable.  We need to change that. So we should:   Aim to stir something real and human in people Make them feel “warm” by feeling understood  Invite them to discover full flavor, not dictate it to them   But  NOT  be inauthentic The “third rail” for this brand would be steering into Hallmark tropes that feel inauthentic and like we’re deliberately trying to pull on heartstrings. We should avoid:  Trying to force feelings in people Feel insincere rather than authentic (“see, we have feelings”) Overstating our role (“with Philly, you’ll have the perfect family”)

---

### Slide 64

MASTERFUL  We should ensure this doesn’t make us feel like cold, heartless gatekeepers of the industry we created.   The goal is for people to feel like we put real work into making really great products through 150+ years of earned expertise. We should be proud Philadelphia isn’t proud about being the biggest. We’re proud of staying true to a heritage of masterful dairy craftsmanship that created the full flavor that made us the most sought after cream cheese and cream cheese of choice for chefs and proud partners like Junior’s.  So we should:   Put love for food first, not love for ourselves Honor our roots and how they still matter today  Present our mastery as a commitment to craft over commerce  (“each batch takes 14 hours because anything less would cheat people out of full flavor”)   But  NOT  “prideful” We don’t want to be cold, heartless gatekeepers of the industry we created or be so boastful that we can seem close-minded.   We should avoid:  Acting like we’re the best simply because we’re the biggest Leaning solely on being the “first” – we’ve also put in the most work Sounding close-minded or outdated

---

### Slide 65

LIGHT- HEARTED  We should ensure that this brand feels as light as our product is, as it will help reinforce permissibility.  The goal is to break the perception of being cold &amp; corporate that comes with our size, but also a feeling of stuffiness and heaviness that can come when gray is a primary brand color and when we’re a brand that’s been around so long. We should be easygoing With a target that wants to make special things for people, they are prone to overthinking or feeling anxious over choosing what to cook. Let’s lighten the mood for them and ease their mental load, especially since our product is actually  light   and so transformative it can lighten their stress.   We should:   Remind them food is meant to be fun &amp; flavorful Get them to worry less so they can enjoy moments more Elevate their food while easing the pressure they feel But  NOT  edge-less (basic or vanilla) We also don’t want to feel so casual that we don’t have any edge. We are trying to wake them up to our brand and new behavior, after all.  We should avoid:  Feeling forgettable as we try to depressurize Having no POV behind our playfulness Being too safe in how we engage them

---

### Slide 66

INVENTIVE  We should ensure this makes us feel modern, but in a way that is born out of our roots rather than just chasing trends.  The goal is celebrate invention and innovation as part of our DNA both 150 years ago and today. We should be daring When Philadelphia invented cream cheese, it was in a desire to create something even creamier than the European standard for soft cheese. We keep that same spirit today: inventiveness that’s bold and admirable. So we should:   Tap into what people want but feels hard to attain Helps people feel as inventive in using Philly as we are in making it Can create buzz from how bold we are in what we do   But  NOT  desperate We also don’t want to feel like we’re just chasing trends that can compromise our sense of quality or desire to give people the full flavor they’ve been missing out on.  We should avoid:  Forcing ourselves into food trends we don’t truly make better Making it feel we’re compromising standards as we modernize Being provocative without a purpose  (ex: tax-free bagel had purpose)
