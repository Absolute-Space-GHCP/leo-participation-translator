### Slide 4

Deepen understanding of Roblox and position the platform as a place where people feel joy, connection, and the freedom to play in their own way. While helping parents understand it gives kids the space to express their creativity, learn new things, and connect with others every day.  THE BRIEF “ “

---

### Slide 5

RECAP OF THE STRATEGY Roblox exists because  kids deserve good spaces  to have fun with their friends. Roblox fills a role every generation has needed: third places for kids to explore freely, build social skills, and practice independence outside of home and school life. It’s full of the freedom that enables the type of fun kids want, but all under one roof that’s controlled by Roblox’s safety measures to ensure it remains a good space for kids.

---

### Slide 6

OUR CREATIVE ‘MUST HAVES’  PROBLEM Roblox’s biggest threat is parental ignorance.  Parents don’t actually understand what Roblox is and what value it offers to their kids,  they hear influential narratives about what happens on it. So, they find it hard to have confidence in something they don’t understand. INSIGHT Parents want to protect their kids, but also know they need some independence.  Especially after the era of helicopter parenting, it’s well understood that kids need some leniency to explore the world in their own way: they need to find connection, creativity, and new possibilities of their own making. OPPORTUNITY Embody the belief that  “your kids deserve good spaces to have fun with their friends.”  Roblox fills a role every generation has needed: third places for kids to explore freely, build social skills, and practice independence outside of home and school life.  It’s full of the freedom that enables the type of fun kids want, but all under one roof that’s controlled by innovative &amp; constantly improving safety measures to ensure it remains a good space for kids.  OBJECTIVE Win on the irrefutable positive we persistently protect.  This isn’t a debatable truth. Kids do deserve good spaces to have fun with their friends. That is why Roblox exists and its why the brand never stops innovating on keeping Roblox a good space for kids that they actually want to use with their friends.

### Slide 11

With worlds of gaming, creation, exploration, socializing, and fun…  the list goes on… on Roblox, the possibilities are endless. Idea One

---

### Slide 12

Idea One The world is full of everything.  Every rule. Every warning. Every reason to slow down.  Kids don’t need more of that. Nobody does.  We need room.  Room to make something strange. Follow an idea wherever it may go.  Play without the weight of the world weighing us down.  We don’t need everything.  We need anything.  Anything to imagine. Anything to build. Anything to explore with friends.  We need a place where curiosity can roam,  creativity can stretch, and play can go as far as it should— without going where it shouldn’t.  There’s a difference between everything and anything.  Everything is chaos.  Anything is possibility… with boundaries.  Because with boundaries, freedom goes further. Play gets bigger.  When the bumpers are on, there are no gutters. So kids can do more, parents can worry less, and we can all feel good about saying yes.  Not to everything.  To anything.   ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025

### Slide 14

ANYTHING. NOT EVERYTHING. Idea One ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   A world of fun  experiences for players of all ages. Controls &amp; protections  that make it possible for everyone - from parents  to players to feel safe. This idea is all about the endless possibilities on the platform for those looking to explore and play.  With our line, we aim to convey this, while hinting at the limits we enforce to keep the space safe and positive for all players. Desired Takeaway – Players, Parents, and Policymakers:

### Slide 27

Film :30/:60 “Anything. Not Everything.”  (The Musical)  Let’s get kid avatars in the real world, calling for all the  anything’s  they want, that they can experience on Roblox. We have fun with an ongoing list, incorporating a line or two that chimes in with a clear  “no, not that.”   Avatar kid:	Can I jump a mile high from building to building?  Greek chorus:	Yes! Avatar kid:	Can I run you over with a locomotive? Greek chorus:	Yes! Avatar kid:	Can I talk to the older kids? Greek chorus:	No, no, no, no, nooooo! Avatar kid:	Then I’m really really fine with the other awesome yeses. Avatar Kid:	So, what we’re saying is Yes to anything, but not everything. Super:		ANYTHING. NOT EVERYTHING. Card:		ROBLOX. (artfully, creatively change shapes, styles)      ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   Idea One ANYTHING. NOT EVERYTHING.

### Slide 28

Shorter forms speak to more specific safety touchpoints…  “Locomotive” :15  A Greek chorus of grown ups with a call and response relationship to an avatar in games, asking for permission.  Avatar kid:	Can I run you over with a locomotive? Greek chorus:	Yes! Avatar kid:	Can I talk to kids a lot older than meeee? Greek chorus:	No, no, no, no, nooooo! Avatar kid:	Then I’m really really fine with that yesssss. Avatar Kid:	So, what we’re saying is…. Super:		ANYTHING. NOT EVERYTHING. Card:		ROBLOX. (artfully, creatively change shapes, styles) VO:		Wth the smartest tools to make the funnest place  		a safe space. ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   Idea One ANYTHING.

### Slide 29

“Robot chickens” :15  A Greek chorus of grown ups with a call and response relationship to an avatar in games, asking for permission.  Avatar kid:	Can i lead an army of robot chickens? Greek chorus:	Yes! Avatar kid:	Can someone stand in my face and curse at meeeeee? Greek chorus:	Noooooo! Avatar kid:	Then i’m totally okie-dokie with your yesss. Super:		ANYTHING. NOT EVERYTHING.

### Slide 30

OR, WHAT IF WE…  ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   Idea One

---

### Slide 31

_YES_BUT Collab What if we collaborated with  @_Yes_but  to create short animations visualizing all the fun,  but not _ , of our platform in their uniquely viral way. (Many times the construct is to reveal a negative, but that’d be part of our distinction) Idea One

---

### Slide 32

Let’s graffiti the world with an Asterisk, meant to show that on Roblox there’s Anything out in the real world… Buuuuut with an asterisk. Just not everything. We can caveat all the different things we find out there to prove the infinite possibilities—er, almost infinite. Idea One The Asterisk* Campaign  * With safeties in place  to make sure they don’t  actually  come home  with anything on their own. ANYTHING. NOT EVERYTHING.

---

### Slide 33

The Museum of Anything (Not Everything) What if we created a virtual and physical library of Anything that has ever existed… but not everything. There will be the ANYTHING part of the museum featuring all of the amazing things on the platform—and then the disused, dilapidated, dusty part of the platform to feature EVERYTHING. (The bullies, censored words, and more) Idea One

---

### Slide 34

Let’s create a content series similar to Rick &amp; Morty’s Interdimensional Cable: a network where (almost) anything is possible. We’ll turn in-game moments into trailers of what’s possible—and what’s not—in Roblox. Anything. Not everything.  Safeties to ensure the funnest place,  is a safe space.  Idea One Interdimensional Cable by

### Slide 35

‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   WAYS OF WORKING TWO

---

### Slide 36

Insight In a world full of noise, pressure, and expectation, people need a place where they can try things safely, without being defined by them.  From kids to adults, everyone needs somewhere to try. To fail, to fall, to get eaten.   Idea Two

---

### Slide 37

Roblox provides the space for play and exploration to unleash, with just enough safety features to keep things safe and appropriate for the age of the user. The digital safety guardrails for you to live your craziest digital life. Idea Two

---

### Slide 38

Life fills up fast.  Schedules. Expectations. Pressure.  You feel it. Kids feel it too.  That’s why we play.  Not as a reward. Not as a distraction. But as relief.  And on Roblox, we play hard.  Because when you know the ground will catch you,  You’re willing to jump higher.  When you’re bundled up you don’t fear the cold.  You run into it, mouth open to catch the snow. Roblox is where pressure drops and imagination takes over.  A place to fall further. To try bigger. To go wilder with friends.  Because you know the cushion is there to catch you.  Laugh without keeping score.  Explore without looking over your shoulder.  Just be… for a while. Not too serious. Not too grown up. Just the right amount of weird.  Because we all deserve to live a little.  And when you feel safe in your special place, you live a little and play a lot more.  Idea Two

### Slide 39

Ready. Set. PLAY. Idea Two ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025

---

### Slide 40

Ready. Set. PLAY. ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   This idea frames Roblox as a place players can  truly let go, &quot;go wild&quot;, and have the most fun — because they know they are in a safe space. With our line, we aim to signal that the groundwork is done and the safety measures are set, clearing the way for instant, carefree enjoyment of the experiences we offer. All the care, setup &amp; safeguards that Roblox has put in place to allow for… the unleashing of fun across almost infinite player experiences. Desired Takeaway – Players, Parents, and Policymakers: Idea Two

---

### Slide 41

Creative Approach In this campaign, we focus on a cadence of prep before wild action. The  buckle-up  then wild ride.  The safer you are,  the more fun you can have. Idea Two

### Slide 46

LAUNCHING WITH A RETAKE ON A KNOWN CLASSIC…  ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   Idea Two

---

### Slide 47

Ready for Anything…   Idea Two To the campy tune of “Tubthumping” by Chumbawamba, we’ll see the fun in being safe to explore on the platform across experiences. The failures, the knockouts, the… getting eaten. All the crashing and burning explored safely thanks to the platform’s features. Gradually going from tragic to hopeful as experience across fields grows.  READY. SET. PLAY.

---

### Slide 48

WHICH COULD BE FOLLOWED BY A SERIES OF LIVE ACTION SHORTS SHOWING WHAT YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH, ONCE YOU’RE SAFE ENOUGH TO DO IT. ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   Idea Two

---

### Slide 49

Safe to Drive  We see the clicking the seatbelt.  Checking of mirrors.  Testing both turn signals.  Shift into Drive… Then flooring it, dramatically exploding through barriers.  We see the driver’s exhilarated expression as our end super comes on screen.  SUPER: 	The safer you are,  		the more fun you can have.  		ROBLOX. READY. SET. PLAY. ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   Idea Two Safe for a Pounding We see someone putting on a complete medieval suit of armor piece by piece.  They close the helmet lid, and enter a room of kids going crazy with bats.  SUPER: 	The safer you are,  		the more fun you can have. We hear ridiculous giggling through the helmet. 		ROBLOX. READY. SET. PLAY.

---

### Slide 50

OR WHAT IF WE… ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   Idea Two

---

### Slide 51

The Softstacle Course What if we built a real-world obstacle course where everything is padded, inflatable, or absurdly cushioned? Kids and adults are encouraged to go bigger, jump higher, and try riskier moves—because they know the environment has their back. A physical metaphor for how safety unlocks freedom. Idea Two

---

### Slide 52

World of Our Own’s What if we created video &amp; imagery showing the world of everyone only the same ages. Our age protections visualized, allowing the appropriate fun for that group to follow. A world of 14 year old’s with really bizarre architecture, color, &amp; their biggest interests on the platform. More refined, edgy 18 year olds &amp; their interests. Idea Two

---

### Slide 53

Itsfunneh / KREW Roblox Fam: Safety First Our consumers have heroes that get themselves ready before going to do what they do—skaters, football players, even musicians. Let’s assemble this group as our spokespeople and create individual assets that speak to how they get ready to have the most fun. Idea Two Conan Gray Patrick Mahomes Lankybox

‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   WAYS OF WORKING THREE

---

### Slide 55

Insight Every generation says it to the previous one:  You just don’t get it. But even if those generations don’t get the  how , it’s always the same  why. You don’t have to get the whole thing to get  the  thing, you know the feeling when play is right.  Idea Three

---

### Slide 56

This is especially true when it comes to forms of play on Roblox. With kids’   imaginations unleashed, it’s never going to fully make sense to adults and That’s okay. They can still be assured safety measures are in place to make it a positive platform. It may look different, but acts the same.  Idea Three

---

### Slide 57

‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   You might not know the rules. You might not recognize the games.  You might not understand how it all works.   But you know the feeling.   You know what it’s like to have a place where time disappears. Where imagination takes over.  Where your body runs first and your worries fade behind.   We all grew up playing somewhere.  A backyard. A blacktop. A basement. A treehouse.  And wherever you played, you protected.   Now that somewhere is here.  A place built for play. By players for players.  A place for trying things.  For being loud, weird, curious, and free.  A place to play together.   Yeah, the lingo might sound different.  The jokes, a little left. The games a little… huh?  But don’t worry, they know what they’re doing. &amp; there’s protections in place for what they aren’t quite ready for.  That’s how this place works.  You don’t have to understand the mechanics, to understand the magic.  You don’t have to play the game, to know what the game gives you.  You don’t have to get it, to get it.  You just have to know, we’re here to play.   Idea Three

---

### Slide 58

You don’t have to get it to get it,    Here to Play.     ALT: Where we play. ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025

---

### Slide 59

Here To Play ‹#› PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL | JOHANNES LEONARDO   ©   2025   The “good space” – a self contained destination with set, strict boundaries. …and the FUN that happens on the platform, which can adapt to show the variety of experiences. This idea frames Roblox as the modern successor to the backyard: the rules have changed, but the feeling of safety remains the same. Our line sets the strict guidelines as to what kind of behaviors we’re are here to create and reinforce. Play will be primary, but it can adapt for other behaviors such as creating, learning,  etc . Desired Takeaway – Players, Parents, and Policymakers: Idea Three

---

### Slide 60

Creative Approach We'll hear from players themselves, across ages and interests, as they act as our guides through various spaces.  Showing how safety might look different to some, but always acts the same, in a world where anything is possible. Idea Three

### Slide 70

“Roblox Cribs” In a series much like an MTV Cribs or AD home tour, let’s have kids as their avatars proudly take us through their different [nonsensical-to-some] Roblox worlds.  Each incorporating moments that naturally and clearly demonstrate a safety feature on the platform.  This becomes a fun product demo for kids, and a glimpse into the world for parents, whether it makes sense to them or not.  With a hint of reassurance of protections on the platform.  A younger gamer  could give us a tour of their space and closet, but come across a couple doors they can’t open just yet. (Age restrictions) A 14ish y/o gamer  could give us a tour of their ocean &amp; all the ships &amp; kids to eat, with some cannon-fire knocking out explicit language attempting to come into frame. (Content Maturity) An 10ish y/o animal lover  could show off their dozens of adopted pets &amp; share to older sibling (Trusted Connections)  HERE TO PLAY.

---

### Slide 72

A Game for Parents, Built by Kids What if real Roblox players built  a game specifically for parents— designed to teach them how the platform works, both through official safety features and the unwritten rules kids already follow? The experience would guide parents through what to do, what not to do, and how kids actively self-police their communities—showing that safety isn’t just enforced by systems, but upheld by players themselves. Parents don’t need to master the mechanics to understand the culture.  Idea Three

---

### Slide 73

Here to Play, safely. What if we use technology to remind adults of nonsensical fun, of the joy of being something different, to surprise and delight, during the business day commute. By reinterpreting their reflection as they would appear in Roblox.  Every move, every motion reflected back perfectly.  Less explanation, more feeling. Inviting them to play with a single message:  DON’T WORRY, THIS IS A SAFE SPACE.  DO YOUR THING. HAVE A LITTLE FUN.  Idea Three

---

### Slide 74

Ask Your Kid (OOH) What if we launched an OOH takeover written entirely in Roblox / Gen Z / Gen Alpha language—completely unreadable to adults? At the bottom of each placement, one simple line: “Ask your kid.” Instead of explaining Roblox, we spark real conversations and flip the power dynamic back to where it belongs.  Idea Three
