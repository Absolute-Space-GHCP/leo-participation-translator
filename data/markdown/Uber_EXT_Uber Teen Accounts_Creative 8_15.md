### Slide 2

Where we are teen accounts   Uncovered a significant tension:parents that wish they could drive their teens, but can’t.   Uncorked that insight with a range of work and design elements that  prove the value of Uber teen accounts without degrading our base product. Narrowed the range of work to a base plan to execute with excellence for our fall launch.  Today, we’ll share a specific set of base plan executions to select for  production to be in market on a staggered launch timing starting  October 2, and  discuss  next steps for  production .

‹#› HOW WE’LL TREAT UI Teen perspective The teen’s perspective will appear as UI overlay that is showing us what they are seeing from the phone’s POV.   Since our teens are looking at app UI, we should pull from the Uber app, simplifying where need be but using the Uber design  language  to make these UI moments ownable.  Our teen moments will mostly focus on requesting a ride. Parent perspective All parent perspective UI will pop up like they do as real push notifications, either on a phone or within the space, depending on the angle.  Our parent UI will focus on highly rated drivers and trackable trips with map UI.   Now      Home   5 MIN   Pick-up    Track your son’s ride   Jill Your daughter is on the way
