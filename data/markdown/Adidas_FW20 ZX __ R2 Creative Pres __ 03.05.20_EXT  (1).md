THE   ZXIENCE   NETWORK A   network   that   turns   our   shoes   -   and   the experience   of   wearing   them   -   into   shows   that mesmerize   the   senses ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_P.   011 Let’s   invite   Sporty   Teens   to   escape   into   a   world   where the   oddly   satisfying   is   everywhere:

### Slide 12

ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_P.   012 ZXN   is   24   hour   looping   stream   of   ZX- themed   oddly   satisfying   content,  featured   on   an   existing   channel   /   platform. The   network   theme   allows   us   to   create   content   that   attracts   and   holds   the   attention   of   Sporty   Teens,   while   also   heroing   ZX   and   it’s   mesmerizing attributes. Tactics   will   evolve   over- time   to   sustain   interest   throughout   the   product  drops.   Cutdowns   and   pulls   from   product-centric   ZXN   content   will   be  reused   throughout   as   paid   advertising. Our   channel   recommendation   for   the   Network   is   Youtube,   as   it  has  significantly   more   scale   amongst   Sporty   Teens  than   other   content  streaming   networks.   It   also   has   a   strong   discoverable   ecosystem   already  built   into   the   platform. ZXN:   HOW   IT   WORKS Why   am   I   so   obsessed   with  this   network   about   a   literal  shoe Adidas   Originals   latest   shoe   is   as   soothing  as   it   is   absurd

ZXIENCE   WITHIN We’ll   bring   ZX’s   Wrapped   Boost   to   life   by   showing   objects  being   “wrapped”   into   other   objects   in   oddly   satisfying   ways.

ZX   AFTER   HOURS In   the   wee   hours   of   the   morning,   we’ll   fill   otherwise   empty   air   time   with   ZX   product   porn—literally. Playing   with   light,   sound,   and   texture,   the   ZX   is   presented   in   a   comically-seductive   way. We’ll   utilize   the   filmic   tropes   of   “product   porn”   (which   is   usually   oddly   satisfying)   and   actual  pornography   in   an   entirely   G- rated   manner.

So   little   time. A   world   of   sensation   and   color, waiting   to   be   experimented   with. Three   different   ZX   colorways   rub   up   against   each   other. Marvelous. Feel   the  ZXience.  ZX. SQUISHINESS ZX   sits   on   a   lazy   susan   next   to   a   roaring   fire   and   a   sheepskin  rug. Soft   and   squishy.  Stiff,   yet   hard. Very   fresh.   Hasn’t   left   the   box. Waiting   for   hand   feel. The   ZX   wrapped   boost   is   poked   by   a   hand,   testing   for   squishiness. Intriguing. Feel   the  ZXience.

Looks   a   bit  dirty.  Let’s   clean   it  off. The   ZX   gets   sprayed   with   a   shower   hose,   showing   off   the   durability. The   inside   is   so   soft.   Might   wear   it   bare   foot. Satisfaction. Feel   the   ZXience.  ZX. COMPRESSION The   ZX   sits   on   a   lazy   susan   in   a   dark   room. Incredibly   tight   mesh.  Wraps around  the  ankle. The   leather   glove   squeezes   the   Wrapped   Boost   heel, showing   off   the   compression. Bound,   like   a   bodysuit.   Close   to   the   skin.   Almost   like   leather. Delightful. Feel   the   ZXience.  ZX. ***Plan   to   be   intentionally   low- fi,   that   will   use   simple   props   that   allude   to   these   settings***

### Slide 22

PRODUCT   TESTS We’ll   show   how   a   product   is   tested   the   ZXience  way. Each   segment   will   feature   ZXience   lab   robots   that   perform   oddly   satisfying   tests   directly   on   the   ZX. These   are   a   mixture   of   short   bumpers   (which   can   be   repurposed   for   IG   stories)   and   comically   drawn  out   tests.

### Slide 23

Squish/Softness: A   robot   arm   squeezes   a   series   of   squishy   objects,   a   burrito,   a   marshmallow,  and   a   water   balloon.   The   Robot   arm   squeezes   the   Boost   heel,   then  continues   to   squeeze   it   for   an  hour. Card:   Tested   with   ZXience. Gradient: A   robot   starts   a   clock   setting   off   a   time- lapse   of   a   colorful   flower   growing, blooming   and   fading.   The   robot   arm   then   does   the   same   for   the   ZX.   The   ZX  stays   the   exact   same. Card:   Tested   with   ZXience. Boost: A   vase   is   dropped   by   a   robotic   arm,   it   shatters   in   slow   motion.   A   ZX   bounces. Card:   Tested   with   ZXience.

### Slide 24

ZXIENCE   REPORT We’ll   invite   interesting   people   to   join   a   host   like   Kerwin   Frost   in   a   studio  for   an   absurd   ASMR   interview   where   whispering  is   a   requirement. Halfway   through   each   chat,   we’ll   break   for   a   commercial  the   same   way   podcasts   do   to   highlight   a   benefit   of   the   shoe.

### Slide 26

THE   ZX   IS  PRESENT Inspired   by   the   reactions   people   had   in   The   Artist   is   Present,  we’ll   make   an   irreverent   version   for   the  ZXience   Network.

---

### Slide 27

THE   ZX   IS  PRESENT In   this   show,   we’ll   watch   assets   like   Stormzy   and   Yara   sit   down   across   from  the  ZX   and   have   powerful,   comical,   emotional   reactions   to   staring   at   the   shoe. Hooked   up   to   a   lie-detector- like   machine,   we’ll   see   ZXientific   to   measure   how  they   feel   from   looking   at   ZX. Then,   we’ll   extend   this   by   installing   the   exhibit   in   places   where   the   sporty   teen  already   is. After   they’re   invited   into   a   sensorial,   one   person   box,   they’ll   stare   at   the   shoe  for   one   minute   while   we   record   them   and   post   the   footage   on   social.

### Slide 30

We’ll   create   a   baking   show   that   celebrates   oddly   satisfying  moments   in   the   kitchen.   For   a   ZX   twist,   we’ll   send   bakers   the  ZX  and   have   them   create   edible   replicas   of   it.   They’ll   document  the  process,  and   each   episode  will  highlight   a  different   product benefit. We   could   also   work   with   PR   to   film   talent   eating   the   ZX   replica cakes. ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_ P.   030 ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_ ZXIENCE   NETWORK GET   BAKED   WITH   ZX longform

### Slide 31

HOW   IT’S   MADE WITH   ZXIENCE We’ll   hold   our   audience’s   attention   by   playing   off   slow   TV   tropes   and   How   It’s   Made. Each   episode   will   feature   a   satisfying   process.   These   will   be   a   blend   of   man- made   construction   and   soothing automation.

### Slide 32

Squish/Softness: A   montage   of   ice   cream   made   in   a   factory. Color   Gradient: A   time   lapse   of   painting   a   huge   gradient   inspired   by   the   ZX   color   pallette. Boost: The   process   of   Boost   beads   popping. Comfort: The   process   of   a   person   weaving   a   gigantic   blanket. Compression: The   process   of   crushing   junked   cars   into   cubes. *commissioned   +   licensed   content* ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_ P.   032 ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_ ZXIENCE   NETWORK HOW   IT’S   MADE   WITH   ZXIENCE long- form

A   PORTRAIT   OF SATISFACTION We’ll   create   a   show   where   a   talented   Photoshop   artist   comps   portraits   of   the  ZX.

---

### Slide 34

We’ll   create   a   show   where   a   photoshop   artist   comps   a   portrait   of   the   ZX.   With   their   satisfying   speed   and   skill,   episodes   will   touch   on  product   benefits  through   metaphors   like  clouds,   rainbows,  love   and  swaddled   animals. Comfort   example: The   ZX   is   comped   on   puffy   clouds.   A   fluffy   cat   is   added   next   to   it,  then   sweatpants   are   comped   on   the   cat   making   it   extra   comfy.

### Slide 35

ZXIENCE   EXPLAINED In   this   show,   we’ll   explore   “the   why”   of   the   oddly   satisfying. While   a   narrator   pontificates   on   the   “theories”   of   ZXience,   we’ll   show   compelling,   can’t   look   away,   feel  good   examples   that   bring   aspects   of   the   shoe   to   life. Our   narrator   could   be   an   Originals   asset   with   a   recognizable   voice,   (i.e.   Stormzy),   who   delivers   each  line   like   they’re   real   and   logical.

ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_ P.   036 ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_ ZXIENCE   NETWORK ZXIENCE   EXPLAINED SQUISHINESS People   poke   squishy   materials. No   law   of   classical   physics quantifies   squishiness,   but   the  theory   of   texture   does. Don’t  overthink   it.  Feel   the   ZXience.   ZX. BOOST A   collage  of   satisfying   explosions. Going   from   red   to   blue   generates  an   energy.   Quantifiable   only   by  the   amount   of   explosions   created  by   the   article. Don’t  overthink   it.  Feel   the   ZXience.   ZX. Colored   gradients   mix   together. Standard   infusion   relies   on  black  and   white.   Whereas   gradient infusion   formulates   disparate shades   on   the   color   wheel. Don’t  overthink   it.  Feel   the   ZXience.   ZX. COLOR   GRADIENT

### Slide 37

PLANET   ZX Inspired   by   the   oddly   satisfying   aspects   of   Planet   Earth,   we’ll   place   ZX   in   environments   that   reference   nature.   Comedic voice- over   from   an   Originals   asset   talks   about   the   shoe   like   it’s   a   wild   animal. To   create   these,   we’ll   work   with   content   creators   known   for   their   camera   magic   skills   around   the   globe.

### Slide 38

ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_ P.   038 ADIDAS_ZX_FW20_ ZXIENCE   NETWORK PLANET   ZX SQUISHINESS We’ll   see   the   ZX   walk   across   a   muddy,   wet   swampland. The   ZX   squishes   through   it,   sticking   to   mud   while  crickets   chirp   and   frogs   ribbit. Marvelous.  The   Southern   ZX. Having it’s monthly  mud  bath.   An  age- old  tradition, passed   down   for  generations. A   ritual,  an   attempt   to   be…   Squishier. Feel   the   ZXience.   ZX. We’ll   see   the   ZX   walk   across   a   thick   forest   floor. The   ZX   slowly   walks   through  it,  stepping  on   branches  that   crack   while   an   owl   hoots   in   the   distance. Fascinating,   isn’t   it? The   wild   ZX,   camouflaged. Its   red   to   blue   gradient…   blending   right   in. Feel   the   ZXience.   ZX. COLOR   GRADIENT COMFORT We’ll   see   the   ZX   walk   across   an   icy,   frozen   tundra. The   ZX   cautiously   steps   onto   the   ice,   popping   and   crackling. Incredible.   The   Northern   ZX.  Crossing   the  dreaded   tundra. As   its   ancestors   have   done   for   centuries. Making   the   journey   in   search   of  shelter. A   den   where   it   will   find   comfort. Feel   the   ZXience.   ZX.

ZXUMMER   SCHOOL   LESSONS We’ll   create   diagrams   that   look   scientific   but   are   nonsensical.   Each   will   hold   our   audience’s attention   because   they   imply   logic   but   have   none. All   will   feature   the   ZX.   Some   will   nod   to   specific   product   benefits,   but   will   always   remain   absurd   to   avoid feeling   too   commercial.
