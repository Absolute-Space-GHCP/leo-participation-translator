PROJECT BACKGROUND INSPIRATION  The idea for a bologna facemask came from  a playful place. Children and adults across the US have had fun making masks out of bologna slices for years.   How can we take this playful origin and create  a sheet mask with real skin benefits?

Influencers who  “Keep It Oscar”  Keep it Oscar is a way of seeing the world differently. It’s about bringing unexpected smiles to people and not taking things too seriously.   Our ideal influencers are people who share the Keep It Oscar mindset, like model turned non-serious influencer Rianne Meijer ( @rianne.meijer ) .   Our main objective for this collaboration is to connect with influencers who share our brand vision. But they must have an IG, YouTube and/or TikTok account with following. We’re looking for a range of influencers, with BIPOC as a key consideration.

### Slide 9

Influencer Categories These are a few categories we’re thinking are worth exploring (along with a few example accounts).  Let’s look far and wide to find people who will really connect with our product.  Beauty  Influencers in the world of beauty who are relatable to our audience and know  how to poke fun at  the industry.  Example: @skincarebyhyram Food  Influencers who in the food category who have fun with  a non traditional approach to food, recipes, and cooking. Example: @breadfaceblog @mollybaz Lifestyle  Lifestyle influencers who help us all see the world through a less serious lens with delightful unexpected content.  Example: @theannmariejohn Celebrity  Down-to-earth celebrities who don’t take themselves too seriously. Maybe it’s one who is perfect cause you least expect them.  Example:  @awkwafina Wild Card  For all those influencers who don’t fit in a neat little box and have the right mindset for this product.  For example, are there gift guide influencers we can tap? Or other oddly relevant characters like  Daniel Franzese of Mean Girls?

### Slide 10

Task  While we will have a few paid partnerships with influencers, we’d like to proactively approach many more to expand the reach of this campaign.   This proactive arm of our influencer strategy is what we’d like for you to work on.  Let’s create a list of beauty, food, lifestyle, celebrity, gift guide, and other wildcard influencers who Oscar Mayer should send free Bologna Face Masks to.  Hopefully these influencers will love the mask so much that they’ll share it with their following.

### Slide 12

Influencers Tiers  Our ideal scenario is a healthy   mix of Social Superstars and Micro Influencers   with a backup scenario being a  focus on Celebrities .   The final mix of Influencer tiers that we move forward with will be determined by a number of factors that are still being sorted out. That said, we’d like to pursue a mix that takes into account these factors in order of priority.   Best Fit:  Influencer who fit the brief Reach:  What mix of influencers allows us to reach the largest and broadest number of people.  Quality Partnerships:  We’re looking for influencers who are excited to participate in this partnership. Not ones who just want to repost our press release.
