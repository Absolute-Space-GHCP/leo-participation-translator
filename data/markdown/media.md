MOMENT CRITERIA We want to be very smart about how we seed this into the world and pick up as much cultural traction as possible.

We're looking for a moment that: Is talkworthy and will generate coverage and social chatter Is interesting for our audience Is a good fit for talent / has high talent potential  Thought Starters: Emmys  (1/11) or  Grammys  (2/4) - Do we find someone to walk the red carpet with Velveeta blonde hair?  NY Fashion Week  (2/9-2/11) - Do we enlist a designer to have all their runway models dye their hair Velveeta blonde?  Miami Heat NBA Games  (Evergreen) - Do we get Jimmy Butler–Miami Heat player known for his hair antics–to dye his hair for a regular season game?

Creator  Social Defined :  Work that is co-created between brand, agency &amp; creator with the intent of having them create content that makes brands/products more relevant to the consumers they wish to reach.  JL Competency :  Nascent  We’ve become quite adept at identifying the right creators for the right brands; but need to develop processes for briefing and co-creating in ways that builds long-term relationships, and yield better creator collab outputs. Commerce  Social Defined :  Social content that serve up multivariate ways i with different ‘ways-in’ at getting consumers to think about using a product - increasingly ultimately leading to direct social purchase. Loreal partnered with  Mikayla  for a campaign using outrage marketing. The Four Seasons Orlando partnered with baby Kate Wise for social content following a viral  video  feat the brand JL Competency :  Nascent  We’ve got desire to play in this space, but we really haven’t developed ‘muscle’ or work in this space - yet.  While it feels more specialist agency, as more commerce moves to mobile &amp; social; it  will  become a tablestakes offering for modern agencies.
