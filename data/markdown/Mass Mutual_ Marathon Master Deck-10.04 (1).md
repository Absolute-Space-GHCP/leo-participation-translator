### Slide 5

Adopt A Runner ‹#› THE NAME: Adopt a Runner This lets us know that runners are in need of support, and acts as a clear CTA for supporters to get involved.  THE TONE: Fun &amp; Light-hearted We must cut through and engage both cynical New Yorkers and excited out-of-town runners. Playful headlines are paired with simple, plainspoken messaging that helps people understand what it means to Live Mutual. We want this to feel community-driven, so we’ll be leaning into grassroots tactics that tap into the local buzz around the marathon. Visually, we’re using our brand assets in a bold, graphic way that reflects a fun, energetic tone.

### Slide 6

Headline Attention-grabbing headlines receive highest prominence in layout Photography Bold, simple photography give a nod to running and help us achieve an energetic, graphic look that links to the spirit of the marathon Program name / CTA Texting instructions bolded to stand out from copy (still awaiting final code) Standard legal line + texting notice Logo / Live Mutual prominently displayed against hero blue Look &amp; Feel 6

### Slide 17

The Approach There are two placements near the fitness expo at Javits Center, both of which run in rotation with other brands.  The first is a large digital display outside the venue, visible to all passers by. We have the flight from mid-October through the Marathon. We will run generic MassMutual brand communications in the first flight and runner recruitment in the second flight during the expo.  The second is 24 units of digital signage in the Hudson Yards subway station, which is the closest transit station to the Javits Center. This a station takeover where all our ads will be in sync and live for 15 secs every two minutes. We’ll use it primarily for runner recruitment but have some supporter recruitment as well. ‹#›

---

### Slide 18

Javits Center HEADLINES - Phase 1 (SUPPORTER)  Blood, sweat, and cheers. Get a marathoner to cheer for. Text CHEER to 70700  HEADLINES - Phase 2 (RUNNER)  You’ve got your bib, now get your fan. Get a local to cheer for you. adoptarunner.com ‹#›

### Slide 19

Influencer 1:1 Outreach to Runners ‹#›

---

### Slide 20

The Approach We are ghost-writing an email and creating an image attachment for a running influencer to send on our behalf to the leaders of run clubs and (possibly) to individuals who we know are running in the marathon. This softens the nature of the cold-call and makes a more genuine runner-to-runner appeal. We have a long form (email) and short form (direct-message) version.  The leading candidate to assume this role from our HelloSociety partnership is  Scott Jurek   (still TBC)  Scott is a world-renowned ultramarathon champion who has claimed victories in nearly all ultrarunning’s elite trail and road events. He is a vegan chef and the International &amp; NY Times bestselling author of “Eat &amp; Run.” Not only does he have the right running credentials, he is based in Colorado and running the NYC Marathon this year -- a perfect example of the runner we are trying to recruit. ‹#›

### Slide 21

Email Outreach ‹#› Subject:  Club Members Running Marathon in NYC?  Copy:  Hi Sam! My name is Scott Jurek. I’ve been called “The King of Pain” because as an avid ultramarathoner, I know what it’s like to hit a wall and push through. Often times, just knowing that someone is giving me moral support is enough to help me go on.  It’s a feeling no runner should have to go without. That’s why I’m helping MassMutual with their Adopt a Runner effort ( adoptarunner.co   m ) for the marathon in NYC. It matches runners with locals who will come out and cheer for them on November 5th.  Please feel free to share this email and the attached flyer with anyone running the marathon in New York this fall. Sometimes, just knowing someone’s out there rooting for you can make all the difference mentally.  Kind regards, Scott Sam Evans From:  Scott Jurek Club Members Running Marathon in NYC? Hi Sam!

RUNNER RECRUITMENT Approved Runner Headlines New Yorkers know how to make a tourist move faster.  You’re not race ready without a cheering section.  Electrolytes can’t replenish morale.  Hearing your name yelled makes every blister worth it.  New Yorkers can make an out-of-towner hustle.  Give New Yorkers another reason to yell at a tourist.  Break out in sweat and they’ll break out in cheers.  Your heart will be pumping, so will their fists.  Taper your runs, not your enthusiasm.  Their cheers help you forget the blisters.

Supporter Recruitment: The Fastest Billboards Ever The running community loves supporting other runners. So we’ll supply New York Run Clubs (e.g. North Brooklyn, Central Park Run Club, New York Harriers) with customized shirts, and have them double up as free advertising for the program.  The front of the shirt will have a run club or borough name, and the back will essentially be a mobile billboard. As the run clubs take to the street, the people running behind them will become a become a captive audience who can take in the message.  TBD - Include in production brief

### Slide 111

111 THE CONCEPT OF THE CONTENT SERIES: What does it mean to be connected to other people? How do we navigate the complex emotions around needing other people: relying on their support, affection and camaraderie to accomplish all that life demands of us — yet still remain “independent”? Scientists ranging from evolutionary biologists to developmental psychologists have grappled with that duality, and their insight into human nature is powerful: In this age of hyper-digital interactions, we thrive when we can allow ourselves to need and connect with other people — and in turn, reach out and be there for them. It’s a virtuous cycle that creates intimacy, compassion, interdependency — and mutual success. We are excited to embark on creating a unique campaign for MassMutual, in which we will develop a living, breathing social experiment of the innate human need to connect with others, centered on the big race in New York City in November. We will pair three marathon runners — from the U.S. and abroad—with three local supporters, who will engage in a live connection with each runner to learn who they are, what brings them to this momentous event, and howthey can help their #runtogether partner.  Through a series of curated interactions reflected on social media — a window that enables thousands of people to participate in moments of mutuality — the runner and supporter will explore points of inspiration, mutual interest, shared or relatable goals that both are striving for. While we can’t predict the exact dimensions of these authentic moments of discovery, we will work to provide an ideal match of runner and supporter in order to optimize the points of mutuality that will bring this experiment to life — and which we will capture in the Paid Post and Instagram.

// CREATIVE GUIDELINES FOR INFLUENCER POSTS Creative Concept/Theme: Almost 70% of the people running the NYC Marathon are not from NYC, so they may not have locals to cheer for them on November 5th. MassMutual’s Adopt a Runner program aims to match these runners with locals who can come out on race day and cheer for them by name. We want to encourage locals to get matched with a runner so they can both get the most out of the marathon. Key Brand Messaging Points (i.e. luxury, elegance, ease of use): MassMutual believes our lives are richer and more fulfilling when we depend on one another. Key takeaways from the Adopt a Runner program: It feels good to help people, it feels good to be needed, it’s more fun to be at the marathon if you’re supporting someone, you can make a difference for a runner, it’s easy to sign up to adopt a runner Image Direction/Aesthetic (i.e flatlay, action shot, plated finished recipe, color palette): Photography and content should be in line with each influencer’s unique style (i.e., photos along the marathon route might be relevant for some influencers but not all). We’d love to see people showing off how they’re planning on supporting their runner in creative ways (e.g., making t-shirts, making a huge cardboard cutout of their runner’s face, making clever posters, getting a group of friends involved, etc.). Content Must Haves (i.e. one visible logo, influencer in image): Campaign hashtag which is #LiveMutual, tag of @MassMutual, a CTA to sign up to adopt a runner at campaign URL (still TBD but please use adoptarunner.com for now). What to Avoid (i.e. other brand logos, no dark lighting): Avoid mentioning the “New York City Marathon” by name (see Legal Considerations below). Ensure that all photos and comments are fun, positive, and genuine. Please note that the brand name “MassMutual” is written as one word, not “Mass Mutual.” The campaign tagline is two words (“Live Mutual”) except when used as a hashtag (#LiveMutual). And it goes without saying, but please avoid other brands logos or recognizable branded products. Copy Requirements: 1. Copy points/Key phrases (i.e. comfortable/easy to use): Explain the Adopt a Runner program and the ease of signing up:  Most marathoners aren't from NYC and could use a local to cheer for them by name. Just enter some basic info and get matched with a runner who needs you on Nov 5. Encourage New Yorkers to adopt a runner:  If you'll be at the marathon, sign up to cheer for a runner. Inspire creative displays of support:  e.g., get noticed! Make a funny poster or print out a cutout of their face so your runner sees you in the crowd! Campaign Specific Hashtags (i.e. #SeeTheWorld): #LiveMutual Tap-Tag or @ mention (i.e. @HelloSociety): @MassMutual 2. 3. Legal Considerations / Things to look out for: Because we’re not official sponsors of the marathon, we can’t mention “The NYC Marathon” or “The TCS NYC Marathon” by name. Please use other keywords to communicate the event such as “The marathon in New York,” “26.2 through New York City,” or “the marathon on Nov. 5th.” To stay aligned with MassMutual values, please keep all content family-friendly and do not use any obscenities, vulgar language, or derogatory comments towards any person or group.
