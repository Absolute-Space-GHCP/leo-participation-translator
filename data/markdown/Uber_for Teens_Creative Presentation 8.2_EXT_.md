### Slide 17

Parents are magic. We know this.  But unfortunately, not the kind of magic that allows them to be everywhere at once.  And when you’ve got three teens at three schools on three sports teams,  5pm turns into unhappy hour real quick.   That’s why there’s Uber for Teens. But really for parents.  A teen account comes with live trip tracking and trusted highly-rated drivers every time. They get safety and independence. You get to feel there even when you can’t be there.  That’s right. Now you can give your teen a ride without ever getting in a car. Turns out you can be everywhere.   Uber for Teens. Go along for the ride.  M  A  N  I  F  E  S  T  O
