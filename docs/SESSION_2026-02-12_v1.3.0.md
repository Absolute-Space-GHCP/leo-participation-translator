## What Was Done

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| Investigated PDF output size (42KB for sample — normal for text-only jsPDF) | Done |
| Searched for Leo's definition of file upload field (none found — inferred from strategy deck inputs) | Done |
| Lightened gray text across entire dark panel for readability (labels, placeholders, borders, tags) | Done |
| Raised file upload size limit from 50MB to 150MB (covers all PPTX files in data/) | Done |
| Verified PPTX upload + extraction works end-to-end (Google DEMOSLAM — 43 slides, 10,724 chars) | Done |
| Restored JL Internal, JL Reference, Johannes Leonardo to Indexed Clients display | Done |
| Added brand-specific colors to Quick-load Scenarios (Adidas green, Uber blue, Roblox red) | Done |
| Client tags highlight with matching brand color when scenario is selected | Done |
| Added extensive new animations: staggered stat entrances, scale-pop numbers, slide-up sections, cursor blink, ring pulse, scenario button effects | Done |
| Verified all 3 demo options (A, B, C) function correctly (all return 200) | Done |
| Confirmed landing page is already the default at / | Done |
| Added Catchfire copyright/authorship footer to all 5 pages | Done |
| Confirmed cultural intelligence layer sources (Exa.ai + Tavily, 4 parallel searches) | Done |

## Files Changed

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `app/src/app/option-c/page.tsx` | Removed HIDDEN_CLIENTS filter, added activeScenario state, brand-colored scenario buttons with icons, client tag highlighting, Catchfire footer, staggered animations throughout |
| `app/src/app/globals.css` | Added 6 new animation keyframes (jl-stagger-in, jl-ring-pulse, jl-cursor-blink, jl-scale-pop, jl-slide-up, jl-scenario-btn) |
| `app/src/lib/sample-output.ts` | Added brandColor, brandColorLight, icon fields to DemoScenario interface and data |
| `app/src/lib/file-parser.ts` | Raised MAX_FILE_SIZE from 50MB to 150MB |
| `app/src/app/api/upload/route.ts` | Increased maxDuration from 60s to 120s |
| `app/src/app/page.tsx` | Updated footer to Catchfire copyright |
| `app/src/app/option-a/page.tsx` | Added Catchfire footer |
| `app/src/app/option-b/page.tsx` | Added Catchfire footer |
| `app/src/app/option-b/results/page.tsx` | Added Catchfire footer |
| `app/src/lib/claude.ts` | Dual-mode Claude client (Direct API primary, Vertex AI fallback) |
| `docs/DEMO_WALKTHROUGH.md` | Updated with current feature set |

## Key Decisions

- **File size limit**: 150MB chosen to accommodate all agency PPTX files (largest is 82MB Adidas deck). PizZip only extracts XML text, so memory impact is minimal.
- **JL clients restored**: All 12 clients now display. "JL Internal" has 1 indexed doc (social strategy POV). "JL Reference" and "Johannes Leonardo" may have Firestore entries but no manifest-mapped docs.
- **No Leo spec for upload field**: File upload was inferred from Leo's requirements for "Strategy Deck" and "Generic Idea Write-up" inputs. Confirm with Leo during demo.
- **Catchfire branding**: Footer on all pages reads "(c) 2026 Catchfire. All rights reserved. Built by Charley Scholz"

## Dev Server

- **URL:** http://localhost:3005
- **Landing page:** http://localhost:3005/ (3-option selector)
- **Engine Room:** http://localhost:3005/option-c
- **Start command:** `cd app && npx next dev --port 3005`

## Next Steps

- [ ] Live test with Leo and Jan — use a real PPTX dropped into UI
- [ ] Get Resend API key for email delivery (PDF download works without it)
- [ ] Confirm with Leo: Is file upload the right input method for strategy decks?
- [ ] Consider adding Google Slides export (Phase 4) after demo feedback
- [ ] Enable Vertex AI Model Garden for Claude as production fallback
- [ ] Deploy to Cloud Run for remote access

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Start dev server | `cd app && npx next dev --port 3005` |
| Run generation test | Visit http://localhost:3005/option-c, fill form, click Generate |
| Test upload | Drop PPTX/PDF/DOCX into Reference Documents area |
