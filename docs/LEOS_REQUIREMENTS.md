## The Assignment

### Problem Statement

- Decreasing time and budgets for advertising agencies
- Need to deliver JL's strategic approach more consistently and efficiently
- Creatives starting from blank page on each assignment

### Solution Vision

A product/program that creative teams can use on their assignments to:

1. **Input:** Generic idea write-up
2. **Transform:** Using the Participation Framework
3. **Output:** Participation-worthy idea write-up + campaign suggestions

### Additional Outputs

The program should also suggest (all optimized to earn consumer participation):
- Media options
- Creator/influencer partner options
- Initial creative concepts

## Data Foundation

### The 3 Folders

| Folder | Contents | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Participation Presentations** | 36+ creative presentations with participatory ideas | Training data - "What good looks like" |
| **Media Options Collection** | Example media placements and channels | Reference library - "Where participation can happen" |
| **Creator Options Collection** | Example creator/influencer partners | Reference library - "Who can ignite participation" |

### Additional Inputs Per Assignment

| Input | Description | Key Element |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Strategy Deck** | Developed by JL team (Google Slides) | The "Shared Interest" reframe |
| **Business Considerations** | Budget, timeline, constraints | Practical boundaries |

### The Shared Interest Reframe

The most important element to extract from strategy decks:

> The reframe of the original client ask into the **Shared Interest Statement** that:
> 1. Allows brand to **rise above the category**
> 2. Creates participatory work because **consumer is predisposed/aligned**
> 3. **Breaks through advertising noise**

---

## Input Specifications

### Generic Idea Write-up

- **Length:** Few paragraphs, single page
- **Format:** Manifesto-style
- **Source:** Creatives developing participation platforms

### Strategy Deck Structure

Typical elements (vary per assignment):
- Shared Interest
- Instigation Plan
- Participation Platform
- Modeled Results

---

## Output Specifications

### Critical Rule

> **Framework is USED but NOT VISIBLE in output**
> Output must flow seamlessly with minimal interruption

### Tier A: High-Level Summary

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Participation Worthy Idea Write-up** | Transformed manifesto (seamless flow) |
| **Overall Creative Approach** | Direction for ideas |

| **Creator/Influencer Strategy Overview** | Talent approach |

### Tier B: Specific Executional Recommendations

Each recommendation MAY combine (as appropriate):
- Creative idea
- Media choice
- Creator/influencer choice

**Important:** NOT every suggestion needs all three elements.

**Examples:**

## Key Quotes from Leo

> "Johannes Leonardo was specifically created to help brands thrive in this new era, where consumers were more empowered than ever."

> "Calling an end to the era of disrupting our way to attention, and instead introducing the era where the onus is on the brand and its advertising agency to earn consumers participation through their work."

> "The goal would be that a creative can input an idea write up and the program translates that generic idea write up into a participation idea write up."

> "Ideally as the inputs strengthen, as feedback is provided as to what is working and not working about the outputs, and improvements are made to program it should become more and more sophisticated with its suggested plan."
