# Mandatory AI Development Plugins

**IMPORTANT:** At the start of EVERY new project or first session in a workspace, verify these 3 plugins are installed and configured.

## Quick Verification Checklist

```
[ ] claude-mem - Worker running, context rule exists
[ ] code-simplifier - Plugin folder exists in .cursor/plugins/
[ ] superpowers - Documented in CLAUDE.md (Claude Code CLI plugin)
```

---

## 1. Claude-Mem (Persistent Memory)

Provides persistent memory across AI coding sessions. Automatically captures tool usage, file edits, and shell commands.

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check worker is running
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:37777/api/readiness
# Expected: {"status":"ready","mcpReady":true}

# Check project is registered
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:37777/api/projects
```

### Project Configuration Required

Each project needs:
1. **Context rule file:** `.cursor/rules/claude-mem-context.mdc`
2. **Context populated:** Should show recent observations, not "No previous sessions"

### Fix Missing Context

```bash
# Refresh context for a project
PROJECT="project-name"
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:37777/api/context/inject?project=${PROJECT}" > .cursor/rules/claude-mem-context.mdc
```

### Start Worker (if not running)

```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack && bun run worker:start
```

---

## 2. Code-Simplifier Plugin

Simplifies and refines code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving functionality.

### Verify Installation

Check for: `.cursor/plugins/code-simplifier/agents/code-simplifier.md`

### Install for New Project

Create the directory structure and agent file:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/plugins/code-simplifier/agents
```

Then create `.cursor/plugins/code-simplifier/agents/code-simplifier.md` with the standard agent definition (copy from an existing project like leonnes-prod).

### Agent File Contents

The code-simplifier.md should contain:
- YAML frontmatter with `name: code-simplifier`, `model: opus`
- Instructions to preserve functionality while simplifying
- Project-specific coding standards from CLAUDE.md
- Focus on recently modified code

---

## 3. Superpowers Plugin (Claude Code CLI)

Provides structured workflows for TDD, systematic debugging, and collaborative planning.

### Verify Installation

In Claude Code CLI, check available commands:
```
/superpowers:brainstorm
/superpowers:write-plan
/superpowers:execute-plan
/superpowers:tdd
/superpowers:debug
```

### Install (in Claude Code CLI)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Document in CLAUDE.md

Each project's CLAUDE.md should have an "AI Development Tooling" section documenting all 3 plugins with:
- Installation instructions
- Key commands/capabilities
- When to use each plugin

---

## New Project Setup Procedure

When starting a new project:

1. **Create `.cursor/rules/` directory**
2. **Initialize claude-mem context:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .cursor/rules
   # Context will auto-populate on first session
   ```

3. **Add code-simplifier plugin:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .cursor/plugins/code-simplifier/agents
   # Copy code-simplifier.md from template project
   ```

4. **Update CLAUDE.md** with AI Development Tooling section including all 3 plugins

5. **Verify claude-mem worker** is running globally

---

## Template Locations

Copy configurations from these established projects:
- **leonnes-prod:** Full plugin setup with all documentation
- **jl-dev-environment-gm:** Complete .cursor/plugins structure
- **glados-ba-reconciliation:** Updated CLAUDE.md with all plugin docs

---

*This rule applies globally to all workspaces. Plugins enhance AI development quality and session continuity.*
