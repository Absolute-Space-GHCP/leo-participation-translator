# Session Log: 2026-02-03

**Project:** The Participation Translator
**Final Version:** 1.0.2

---

## Session 1 (v1.0.0) - Initial Planning

**Time:** Morning
**Focus:** Project kickoff and architecture planning

### Accomplishments
- Received and parsed project handoff document
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with 6-phase implementation roadmap
- Created detailed technical architecture documentation
- Updated project CLAUDE.md with Participation Translator context
- Created initial src/ directory structure
- Scaffolded core library modules with TypeScript stubs
- Created 8-Part Participation Framework system prompts
- Updated .env.example with all required environment variables

### Key Decisions
- **Embedding Model:** Vertex AI text-embedding-005 (768 dimensions)
- **Vector Store:** Vertex AI Vector Search
- **Generation Engine:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Vertex AI
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 + React 18 + Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Cloud Run

## Session 2 (v1.0.1) - Architecture Revision

**Time:** Midday
**Focus:** Multi-agent architecture transformation

### Accomplishments
- Transformed monolithic design into multi-agent architecture
- Created 5 subagent definitions (2 active, 3 placeholders)
- Implemented knowledge graph alongside vector search
- Created task-based model routing
- Completed Phase 0 Foundation Setup

### Key Decisions
| Original | Revised |
|----------|---------|
| Monolithic Next.js | Multi-agent with delegation |
| Single model | Task-based model routing |
| Vector search only | Vector search + Knowledge Graph |
| PPTX output | Google Slides (native to JL) |

### Files Created
- `.cursor/agents/*.md` - 5 subagent definitions
- `.cursor/rules/agents.mdc` - Agent delegation rules
- `.cursor/skills/participation-rag/` - RAG operations skill
- `.cursor/skills/document-analysis/` - Document parsing skill
- `src/lib/memory/knowledge-graph.ts` - JL patterns/campaigns
- `src/lib/router/task-router.ts` - Complexity-based routing
- `docs/GCP_SETUP.md` - GCP project setup guide
