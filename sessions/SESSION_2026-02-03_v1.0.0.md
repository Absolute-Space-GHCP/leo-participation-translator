## Architecture Decisions

### 1. RAG Pipeline

- **Embedding Model:** Vertex AI text-embedding-005 (768 dimensions)
- **Vector Store:** Vertex AI Vector Search (GCP-native, can switch to Pinecone)
- **Chunking Strategy:** 512-1024 tokens with 64 token overlap, preserving document structure

### 2. Generation Engine

- **Primary Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Vertex AI
- **Approach:** Chain of Thought reasoning with 3-phase generation (Research → Framework → Pack)
- **Framework:** 9-section Participation Write-up + 5-component Participation Pack

### 3. Cultural Intelligence

- **Primary Sources:** Exa.ai (semantic search) + Perplexity API (search + summarization)
- **Automation:** Zapier/Make.com for daily trend ingestion
- **Caching:** Firestore with 24-hour TTL for cultural data

### 4. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 + React 18 + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Node.js 22)
- **Deployment:** Cloud Run (serverless, auto-scaling)
- **Storage:** Cloud Firestore (sessions/outputs) + Cloud Storage (documents/exports)

## Project Understanding

### Core Concept

The Participation Translator transforms "passive" advertising ideas into "participation-worthy" platforms by:

1. Grounding outputs in JL's historical excellence (vector database of past presentations)
2. Layering real-time cultural intelligence (trends, subcultures, momentum)
3. Applying the 8-Part Participation Framework systematically

### Key Outputs

**A. Participation Worthy Write-up (9 sections):**

1. Current Cultural Context
2. Brand Credibility
3. The Shared Interest
4. The Passive Trap
5. The Participation Worthy Idea
6. Moments and Places
7. Mechanics of Participation
8. First Responders
9. The Ripple Effect

**B. Participation Pack:**

- The Big Audacious Act
- Subculture Mini-Briefs
- Mechanic Deep-Dives (3-5)
- Casting & Creators
- Trend Hijacks (72-hour opportunities)

| Dependency               | Priority | Notes                                       |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| JL Presentations         | HIGH     | VW, Adidas decks for RAG training           |
| Exa.ai API Key           | HIGH     | Sign up required                            |
| Perplexity API Key       | HIGH     | Sign up required                            |
| GCP Project              | HIGH     | `participation-translator` project creation |
| 8-Part Framework Details | MEDIUM   | May need refinement from Leo                |

## Questions for Stakeholder (Leo)

1. Which past presentations should we prioritize for the initial knowledge base?
2. Is the 9-section framework complete, or are there additional elements?
3. Should this be accessible only to Leo, or broader team?
4. Export format preference: PDF, PPTX, or both?
5. Do we have existing Brandwatch credentials?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Get Leo's feedback** on PLAN.md and architecture
2. **Collect initial presentations** for RAG ingestion
3. **Set up GCP project** `participation-translator` with required APIs
4. **Initialize Next.js application** with TypeScript and Tailwind
5. **Begin Phase 1** - Implement document parsers

## Blockers

None at this time. Awaiting stakeholder review and presentation files.
