# Memory Context from Past Sessions

The following context is from claude-mem, a persistent memory system that tracks your coding sessions.

# [leo-participation-translator] recent context, 2026-02-05 1:29pm EST

**Legend:** session-request | 🔴 bugfix | 🟣 feature | 🔄 refactor | ✅ change | 🔵 discovery | ⚖️ decision

**Column Key**:
- **Read**: Tokens to read this observation (cost to learn it now)
- **Work**: Tokens spent on work that produced this record ( research, building, deciding)

**Context Index:** This semantic index (titles, types, files, tokens) is usually sufficient to understand past work.

When you need implementation details, rationale, or debugging context:
- Use MCP tools (search, get_observations) to fetch full observations on-demand
- Critical types ( bugfix, decision) often need detailed fetching
- Trust this index over re-reading code for past decisions and learnings

**Context Economics**:
- Loading: 50 observations (42,372 tokens to read)
- Work investment: 107,327 tokens spent on research, building, and decisions
- Your savings: 64,955 tokens (61% reduction from reuse)

**#2361** " ✅ **Created Markdown Directory README**

A README file was created in the markdown directory to document the conversion system. The CLAUDE.md file explains the three-fold purpose of the Markdown conversion: enabling version control with 4,200x size reduction, providing text-ready content for the RAG embedding pipeline, and maintaining human-readable format for review. It documents the YAML frontmatter structure that each converted file contains, including metadata like slide counts, text density metrics, and conversion timestamps. The file includes the regeneration command for rebuilding the Markdown corpus from source PPTX files, making the process reproducible. Summary statistics provide a quick overview of the corpus: 19 files, 1,026 slides, 363,104 characters totaling ~480KB. This documentation ensures future developers understand the conversion system and can maintain or regenerate the Markdown assets.

**#2362** " 🔵 **Git Status Shows New Converter Feature Artifacts**

Git status reveals the complete scope of the converter feature implementation. Two files were modified: package.json (adding the convert npm script) and the Claude memory context file. Five new items were created: the converter CLI tool (src/cli/convert.ts), the entire markdown output directory with 21 files, and three CLAUDE.md documentation files in data/, data/presentations/, and src/cli/ directories. These changes represent a complete feature addition spanning implementation code, output artifacts, and supporting documentation. All changes are currently unstaged and ready to be committed to version control, establishing the PPTX-to-Markdown conversion capability as a permanent part of the project's toolchain.

The core converter feature has been staged for commit. This includes 23 files: the converter CLI implementation (src/cli/convert.ts), the updated package.json with the npm script, and all 21 files in the data/markdown/ directory (19 converted presentations plus the CLAUDE.md README and one duplicate Google DEMOSLAM file). The staging intentionally excludes three additional CLAUDE.md documentation files in other directories and the Claude memory context file, suggesting a selective commit strategy focusing on the converter feature itself. This staged set represents a complete, self-contained feature: the implementation code, its package.json integration, and the initial conversion output that demonstrates the tool's functionality.

The PPTX to Markdown converter feature has been committed to version control as commit e68098f. The commit includes the complete converter implementation (src/cli/convert.ts), package.json integration, and all 21 files in the data/markdown/ directory demonstrating the tool's functionality. The commit message follows conventional commit format with "feat:" prefix and documents key metrics: 4,200x compression ratio from 1,575MB binary PPTX to 480KB text-based Markdown, covering 1,026 slides and 363,104 characters across 19 client presentations. The 7,640 insertions reflect both the converter code and the substantial Markdown content generated. This commit establishes a permanent capability in the project: the ability to maintain version-controlled, human-readable, git-friendly representations of the presentation library while preserving content for RAG ingestion.

The PPTX to Markdown converter feature has been successfully pushed to the remote GitHub repository. The remote main branch advanced from commit 6ba3474 (the final session handoff documentation from the previous session) to commit e68098f (the new converter feature). This means the converter CLI tool, package.json integration, and all 21 Markdown conversion files are now available in the shared repository at github.com/Absolute-Space-GHCP/leo-participation-translator. The 480KB of converted presentation content is now backed up and accessible to all team members, providing a version-controlled, searchable representation of JL's participation mechanics campaign library alongside the original binary PPTX files.

**#S517** Complete Session Summary: PPTX to Markdown Converter Implementation and Deployment (Feb 5 at 12:36 PM)

**Investigated**: Primary session verified project status at v1.0.3, confirmed all infrastructure dependencies (GCP service account, .env config, data assets), implemented complete PPTX to Markdown conversion system, tested single-file and batch conversions, analyzed output quality and compression ratios, documented the system, and deployed to version control. Examined 19 client presentations spanning Google, Adidas, Uber, Roblox, Old Milwaukee, MassMutual, and Philadelphia campaigns.

**Learned**: The leo-participation-translator project successfully converts PowerPoint presentations to version-controllable Markdown using PizZip to parse PPTX as ZIP archives and extract XML content. The converter generates structured Markdown with YAML frontmatter metadata (slides, characters, text density, notes, timestamps) and preserves slide content with speaker notes. Conversion achieves 99.97% size reduction: ~1.5GB binary PPTX → 480KB text-based Markdown (4,200x compression). The corpus contains 1,026 slides with 363,104 characters across 19 files. Text density classification identifies image-heavy (&lt;50 chars/slide), mixed (50-150), or text-rich (&gt;150) presentations. The 480KB actual output vs 355KB character-based estimate shows 35% overhead from Markdown formatting. All presentations converted successfully with Mass Mutual Marathon (193 slides, largest) and Old Milwaukee BacOff (9 slides, smallest) as extremes.

**Completed**: Shipped complete PPTX to Markdown converter feature via commit e68098f pushed to GitHub. Deliverables: (1) src/cli/convert.ts implementing single-file and batch conversion with analysis mode, (2) npm run convert script in package.json, (3) data/markdown/ directory with 21 files including 19 converted presentations and CLAUDE.md documentation, (4) commit with 7,640 insertions establishing permanent capability. Remote repository at github.com/Absolute-Space-GHCP/leo-participation-translator now contains version-controlled, searchable, human-readable representations of entire presentation library alongside original PPTX files.

**Next Steps**: Session completed converter implementation and deployment. Based on handoff priorities, likely next trajectory is RAG system ingestion: running npm run ingest to generate vector embeddings from presentations and populate the vector database for retrieval testing. Alternative paths include testing retrieval functionality, running the demo walkthrough for Leo, or beginning Reddit integration implementation.
