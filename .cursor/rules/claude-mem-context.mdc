# Memory Context from Past Sessions

The following context is from claude-mem, a persistent memory system that tracks your coding sessions.

# [jl-dev-environment-gm] recent context, 2026-01-27 1:25pm EST

**Legend:** session-request | 🔴 bugfix | 🟣 feature | 🔄 refactor | ✅ change | 🔵 discovery | ⚖️ decision

**Column Key**:
- **Read**: Tokens to read this observation (cost to learn it now)
- **Work**: Tokens spent on work that produced this record ( research, building, deciding)

**Context Index:** This semantic index (titles, types, files, tokens) is usually sufficient to understand past work.

When you need implementation details, rationale, or debugging context:
- Use MCP tools (search, get_observations) to fetch full observations on-demand
- Critical types ( bugfix, decision) often need detailed fetching
- Trust this index over re-reading code for past decisions and learnings

**Context Economics**:
- Loading: 15 observations (3,812 tokens to read)
- Work investment: 10,159 tokens spent on research, building, and decisions
- Your savings: 6,347 tokens (62% reduction from reuse)

**#1155** " 🟣 **GitHub Repository Created for macOS Development Environment**

Successfully resolved the missing GitHub repository issue by switching to the cmscholz222 account, which has organization admin permissions in Absolute-Space-GHCP. Created the public repository jl-dev-environment-gm to match the local repository's remote configuration. This establishes the foundation for achieving 1:1 synchronization between local and remote repositories. The repository is now ready to receive the initial push of the macOS Golden Master development environment codebase, which includes v1.8.0 features with MCP server integrations.

**#1156** " ✅ **Git Remote URL Updated to Match Created Repository**

Updated the git remote origin URL to match the newly created GitHub repository by removing the incorrect v1.0 suffix. The remote configuration now correctly points to https://github.com/Absolute-Space-GHCP/jl-dev-environment-gm.git. However, the initial push to the repository was rejected because the OAuth token lacks the workflow scope required to create or update GitHub Actions workflow files. The repository contains a .github/workflows/slack-notify.yml file that triggered this security restriction, requiring token scope update before synchronization can complete.

**#1157** " ✅ **GitHub Authentication Workflow Scope Addition Initiated**

Initiated GitHub token scope expansion to add the workflow scope required for pushing GitHub Actions workflow files. The OAuth device flow authentication method requires entering the one-time code (38AA-9610) in a web browser to authorize the additional permissions. Once completed, the token will have workflow scope alongside existing repo, gist, and read:org scopes, allowing the initial push of the repository including the slack-notify.yml workflow file to succeed.

**#1158** " 🟣 **Successfully Pushed Local Repository to GitHub**

Successfully completed the GitHub synchronization after adding workflow scope to the authentication token. The entire local repository history, including all commits from v1.7.0 through v1.8.0 with MCP server integrations and documentation updates, has been pushed to the newly created GitHub repository. The local main branch is now properly tracking origin/main, establishing the requested 1:1 verification between local and remote repositories. The macOS Golden Master development environment is now backed up on GitHub and ready for collaborative development.

**#1159** " 🔵 **Verified 1:1 Synchronization Between Local and Remote Repositories**

Verification confirms complete 1:1 synchronization between local and remote repositories as requested. Git fetch followed by bidirectional commit comparison shows zero divergence - no commits exist in either direction that aren't in the other. The repositories are perfectly synchronized at the commit level. The only differences are local working directory changes: modifications to the Claude memory context file and new CLAUDE.md documentation files that haven't been committed yet. The user's goal of ensuring verified 1:1 match with the GitHub repository has been successfully achieved.

**#S180** Establish Verified 1:1 Synchronization Between Local jl-dev-environment-gm Repository and GitHub Remote (Jan 27 at 1:24 PM)

**Investigated**: Performed comprehensive repository status verification including git status, commit history, remote configuration, and GitHub repository existence checks. Discovered the configured remote URL (jl-dev-environment-gm-v1.0.git) pointed to a non-existent repository. Used GitHub CLI to list all repositories in Absolute-Space-GHCP organization, confirming only jl-dev-environment-gm-windows existed. Checked authentication status for both GitHub accounts (AbsoluteELEV8 and cmscholz222) and Google Cloud credentials.

**Learned**: The local macOS development environment had no corresponding GitHub repository due to misconfigured remote URL with v1.0 suffix. Account AbsoluteELEV8 lacked organization admin permissions to create repositories in Absolute-Space-GHCP, but cmscholz222 account has sufficient permissions. GitHub OAuth tokens require workflow scope to push files in .github/workflows/ directory. OAuth device flow authentication enables adding scopes to existing tokens without full re-authentication.

**Completed**: Created safety backup of project to ARCHIVED directory. Created new public GitHub repository at https://github.com/Absolute-Space-GHCP/jl-dev-environment-gm using cmscholz222 account with admin permissions. Updated git remote URL from jl-dev-environment-gm-v1.0.git to jl-dev-environment-gm.git. Added workflow scope to GitHub token via OAuth device flow. Successfully pushed entire local repository history (v1.7.0 through v1.8.0) to GitHub. Verified perfect 1:1 synchronization with zero commit divergence between local and remote.

**Next Steps**: Repository synchronization goal has been achieved. Local and remote repositories are now in verified 1:1 match with main branch tracking origin/main. Only remaining items are uncommitted local working directory changes (.cursor/rules/claude-mem-context.mdc and new CLAUDE.md files) that can be committed or discarded based on user preference.
