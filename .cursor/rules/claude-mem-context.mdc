# Memory Context from Past Sessions

The following context is from claude-mem, a persistent memory system that tracks your coding sessions.

# [leo-participation-translator] recent context, 2026-02-06 12:42pm EST

**Legend:** session-request | 🔴 bugfix | 🟣 feature | 🔄 refactor | ✅ change | 🔵 discovery | ⚖️ decision

**Column Key**:
- **Read**: Tokens to read this observation (cost to learn it now)
- **Work**: Tokens spent on work that produced this record ( research, building, deciding)

**Context Index:** This semantic index (titles, types, files, tokens) is usually sufficient to understand past work.

When you need implementation details, rationale, or debugging context:
- Use MCP tools (search, get_observations) to fetch full observations on-demand
- Critical types ( bugfix, decision) often need detailed fetching
- Trust this index over re-reading code for past decisions and learnings

**Context Economics**:
- Loading: 50 observations (17,428 tokens to read)
- Work investment: 70,742 tokens spent on research, building, and decisions
- Your savings: 53,314 tokens (75% reduction from reuse)

**#2531** " 🔴 **Made context merger trend query year dynamic**

Completed the dynamic year fix by updating the context merger's trend query construction to use the current year dynamically rather than hardcoded "2026". The merger module constructs trend queries in two paths: brand-specific queries (when brand and category provided) and generic queries (when only query string provided), and both now inject the current year using `new Date().getFullYear()`. This completes the maintainability fix started in exa.ts, ensuring all cultural intelligence trend searches across the system remain current without annual code updates. The fix prevents situations where the system searches for "2026 trends" in 2027 or later, maintaining relevance of cultural context data.

**#2532** " 🔴 **Made Tavily trend query year dynamic**

Completed the systematic dynamic year fix across the entire cultural intelligence layer by updating Tavily's trend query construction. The Tavily module (backup search provider) was also hardcoding "2026" in its trend query construction. With this fix, all three cultural intelligence modules (exa.ts, tavily.ts, merger.ts) now dynamically inject the current year using `new Date().getFullYear()`, ensuring consistent, current-year trend searches regardless of which provider is used. This systematic approach prevents the "works in primary but not backup" failure mode where Exa might return current trends while Tavily searches for outdated years. The cultural intelligence layer now maintains relevance automatically as calendar years advance.

**#2533** " 🔄 **Refactored sentiment analysis to use centralized Claude client instead of direct SDK instantiation**

Refactored the sentiment analysis module to use the centralized Claude client infrastructure instead of directly instantiating the AnthropicVertex SDK. Previously, sentiment.ts created its own AnthropicVertex client instance, duplicating client management and bypassing the project's task routing system. The refactor imports callClaudeForTask from the generation module's claude-client, enabling sentiment analysis to benefit from shared client singleton (auth token caching, connection pooling), automatic task-based model selection (likely routing sentiment to Sonnet or Haiku rather than expensive Opus), and consistent error handling patterns. This consolidation reduces code duplication and ensures all Claude API calls flow through the centralized client infrastructure.

**#2534** " 🔄 **Completed sentiment analysis refactor to use centralized Claude client infrastructure**

Completed the sentiment analysis refactor by removing all local client management and direct SDK usage, fully delegating to the centralized Claude client infrastructure. The module previously maintained its own lazy-initialized AnthropicVertex client, made direct messages.create() calls, and manually parsed responses. The refactored version uses callClaudeForTask from the claude-client module, passing 'sentiment_analysis' as the task type to enable intelligent model routing (likely Sonnet or Haiku for cost efficiency rather than Opus). The refactor simplifies the code from ~30 lines of client management, API calls, and parsing to ~8 lines of delegation, while gaining benefits of the shared client (singleton auth caching, connection pooling, task-based model selection, consistent error handling, token tracking, cost estimation). This consolidation ensures all Claude API calls in the system flow through the centralized infrastructure for uniform observability and control.

**#2535** " 🔄 **Updated sentiment module isConfigured check after removing local client**

Updated the sentiment module's configuration check after removing the local Claude client. The isConfigured() function previously called getClaudeClient() to test if the client could be instantiated, which would throw if GCP_PROJECT_ID was missing. With the refactor delegating to the shared client, getClaudeClient() no longer exists. The new implementation simply checks if GCP_PROJECT_ID is set in environment variables, which is sufficient to determine if Claude access is configured since the centralized claude-client requires this variable. This simplified check (environment presence vs. client instantiation) is faster and doesn't require lazy initialization side effects. The function still serves its purpose: indicating whether sentiment analysis can be used.

**#S774** Documentation Accuracy Overhaul: Model Versions, Environment Configuration, and Navigation Index (Feb 6 at 12:42 PM)

**Investigated**: Extended documentation audit beyond initial version synchronization to examine technical accuracy across architecture diagrams, environment configuration examples, and documentation navigation/indexing. Focus on removing legacy references and ensuring consistency with actual implementation.

**Learned**: - Documentation drift was pervasive: wrong model versions in multiple locations (Claude 3.5/Sonnet 4.5 vs actual Opus 4.6)
    - .env.example contained aspirational/unused services creating setup confusion (Reddit API, paid social listening tools, Zapier/Make integrations)
    - Documentation index (docs/CLAUDE.md) still referenced legacy "JL Dev Environment" project and outdated file structure
    - Clear separation needed between "required now" vs "future/optional" in configuration examples
    - Architecture diagrams require updates to match technical stack corrections

**Completed**: **Model Version Corrections:**
    - Architecture documentation: "Claude 3.5 Sonnet" → "Claude Opus 4.6" (multiple diagram references)
    - .env.example: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929" → "claude-opus-4-6"
    
    **.env.example Cleanup:**
    - Removed active Reddit API configuration (moved to commented future section)
    - Removed social listening services (Xpoz, Brand24, Brandwatch with pricing)
    - Consolidated unimplemented integrations: "Social Listening (Phase 3+)" → "Future: Integrations (not yet implemented)"
    - Commented out: TREND_WEBHOOK_SECRET, moved SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL to future section
    - Added Perplexity API as commented future option
    - Result: Clearer distinction between required (Claude, Exa, Tavily, Firestore) vs. optional future features
    
    **Documentation Index Overhaul (docs/CLAUDE.md):**
    - Title: "Documentation - AI Context" → "Documentation Index — The Participation Translator"
    - Removed legacy "JL Dev Environment" references
    - Removed outdated files: DOCKER.md, PRE-SETUP-EMAIL.md, duplicate QUICKSTART.md
    - Added comprehensive documentation table with all actual files:
      * ARCHITECTURE-PARTICIPATION-TRANSLATOR.md
      * CULTURAL_INTELLIGENCE.md
      * DEMO_WALKTHROUGH.md
      * EVOLUTION.md
      * GCP_SETUP.md
      * HOW_IT_WORKS.md
      * LEOS_REQUIREMENTS.md
      * URL_API.md
    - Updated root documentation table: CLAUDE.md, PLAN.md, TASKS.md, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, PROJECT_GUARDRAILS.md
    - Removed generic writing guidelines section

**Next Steps**: Documentation accuracy initiative appears to be reaching completion. The systematic corrections have covered version files, technical references (model versions), configuration examples, and navigation/indexing. Session may be wrapping up v1.1.0 release documentation or moving to next feature work.
